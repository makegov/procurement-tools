      'ADR includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that fall outside of the government  judicial process. Despite historic resistance to ADR by both parties and their advocates, ADR has  gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession in recent  years. In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually  mediation, before permitting the parties'' cases to be tried. The rising popularity of ADR can be  explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer  costs than litigation and provides greater confidentiality. FAR 33.214 discusses ADR.'

      A cost is properly allocable to a contract if it is incurred specifically for the contract or is incurred  for another activity that also benefits the contract. With regard to the allocability of costs claimed,  the COR must look for any direct costs that appear to have no connection with the contract work.  If the COR cannot understand why the contractor would need billed materials or effort to perform  the contract, then the costs may have been charged to the contract in error.

    description: |
      The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub L. 111-5), is an economic stimulus  package enacted by the 111th United States Congress in February 2009. The Act was intended  to provide a stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic downturn. The measures  are nominally worth $787 billion. The Act includes federal tax cuts, expansion of unemployment  benefits and other social welfare provisions, and domestic spending in education, health care,  and infrastructure, including the energy sector. The Act also includes numerous non-economic  recovery related items that were either part of longer-term plans (e.g. a study of the effectiveness  of medical treatments) or desired by Congress (e.g. a limitation on executive compensation in  federally aided banks). The ARRA is much larger than the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which  consisted primarily of tax rebate checks.

The fixed fee does not vary with actual cost, but may  be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract.

  CPIF:
    longform: Cost-plus-incentive-fee contract
    description: |
      A cost-reimbursement contract that provides for the initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by  a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. This contract  type specifies a target cost, a target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee adjustment  formula. After contract performance, the fee payable to the contractor is determined in  accordance with the formula. The formula provides, within limits, for increases in fee above target  fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee below target fee  when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or decrease is intended to provide  an incentive for the contractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is  greater than or less than the range of costs within which the fee-adjustment formula operates, the  contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.
