In contrast to typical practice, the Government does not share the number of hours with the vendors. Instead, the Government asks vendors to submit only the rates, for the price submission factor, of the requested labor categories for the parent award, using the same scenario or estimate for all price evaluations. The submitted rates by the vendors are evaluated by the Government and inputted into the estimated hours or scenario to come up with the total evaluated price for each vendor. The total evaluated price is used for evaluation purposes only. All proposed labor categories and rates are incorporated into the final award. The scenario and results are shared with vendors as a part of their debriefing or when being given a brief explanation of the award decision.\n\u00a0\nROPE is recommended for use when using a best-value tradeoff to award single-award IDIQs and BPAs and may be used in a multiple-award environment. ROPE is highly recommended for labor hour or time-and-materials type IDIQs or BPAs and may be used for other contract types. This technique should not be used for the award of orders against an existing IDIQ or BPA. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nConsider this text in your next solicitation:\n\u00a0\n\u201cTo help select the best value Quoter for this BPA [or IDIQ] opportunity, the Government will use the hourly rates from the BPA [or IDIQ] LCAT Pricing Rate Worksheet/Excel Spreadsheet.

Quoters shall submit the attached pricing worksheet.\u201d\n\u00a0OR\n\u00a0\u201cAll vendors must complete the LCAT Pricing Rate Worksheet by completing all cells not already filled-in by the Government. The Government will then apply those rates to a sample task order scenario to arrive at a total evaluated price to use in the best-value tradeoff analysis. The estimate [or ceiling] provided in the solicitation may assist in coming up with discounted rates for the base period and all option periods. The Government will not disclose this sample task order scenario with vendors.\u201d \n\u00a0\n",
