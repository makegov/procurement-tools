Soft skills (e.g., problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, etc.) are as important as hard skills for individual success. However, current soft-skill assessment tools are subjective, inefficient, and inconsistent. This is especially painful for marginalized populations such as minorities and women, who often possess valuable soft skills such as stress management and conflict resolution, but do not have the tools to demonstrate it. The proposed solution will change how people\u2019s lived experiences and the soft skills associated to those experiences are valorized. This technology may open the door to better educational and professional opportunities in the U.S., to increased economic competitiveness (since higher education plays an increasingly critical role in the economic competitiveness of a nation), to advanced health and welfare of the American public (since adults with higher education often live healthier and longer lives, and enjoy better financial situations), and to a more developed and diverse STEM workforce (by focusing on valorizing the social and cultural capital of minoritized students)._x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project proposes a digital platform that provides soft-skill credentialing guided by lived experiences. The main innovation behind the proposed solution is a proprietary system that combines Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing to analyze the candidate\u2019s experiences and apply different evidence-based social-emotional assessment frameworks to accredit the soft skills embedded in each experience. This solution may be the first time a proprietary ML technology will be integrated with a large language model to provide soft-skill credentialing upon lived experiences. The main technical challenge is avoiding bias in the assignation of soft-skill credentials. Other technical challenges are: 1) the potential scarcity of training data; 2) the correct definition of credential categories; and 3) the ability to explain the ML models. This project is intended to address these challenges by 1) developing a proof-of-concept prototype of the accreditation model; 2) conducting a preliminary analysis of its fairness when assessing marginalized groups; 3) reformulating the accreditation algorithm in case any bias is detected; and 4) evaluating, with real datasets, the performance of the credential classifier, the bias mitigation strategies, and the explanations generated for each assessment._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","award_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2481715"},{"firm":"OCEAN RENEWABLE POWER CO INC","award_title":"Optimized Hydrokinetic Systems","agency":"DOE","branch":"ARPA-E","phase":"Phase II","program":"SBIR","agency_tracking_number":"2335-1515","contract":"DE-AR0001446","proposal_award_date":"2023-10-16","contract_end_date":"2024-10-15","solicitation_number":"DE-FOA-0002335","solicitation_year":"2020","topic_code":"1","award_year":"2021","award_amount":"1704685.00","duns":"831759951","uei":"","hubzone_owned":"N","socially_economically_disadvantaged":"N","women_owned":"N","number_employees":"","company_url":"","address1":"254 Commercial St","address2":"Suite 119B","city":"Portland","state":"ME","zip":"04101","poc_name":"Genetta Mclean","poc_title":"","poc_phone":"(207) 772-7707","poc_email":"gmclean@orpc.co","pi_name":"Jarlath Mcentee","pi_title":"","pi_phone":"(207) 772-7707","pi_email":"jmcentee@orpc.co","ri_name":null,"ri_poc_name":"","ri_poc_phone":"","abstract":"Ocean Renewable Power Company, Inc.

To achieve the low cost of energy envisioned by this FOA, a major re-imagining of the ORPC technical approach is required, with emphasis on reducing effective mass of the systems, as well as improving extraction efficiency, while maintaining the high level of robustness and reliability already demonstrated. ORPC will identify design couplings between subsystems and components to optimize system mass and performance. The focus of this work will be the design of systems to be deployed in arrays, as commercial projects are expected to consist of multiple units and interactions between units are critical for performance and loading. Hydrodynamic testing of model-scale turbines will be performed to guide and validate the concepts. A larger-scale turbine will be constructed, with sensors embedded during manufacture to validate structural design. Open water testing and measurements of performance and loads will be performed by mounting the turbine in an open water test frame, based on the ORPC RivGen\u00ae Power system.

While traditional MRI scanners rely on B0 gradient coils for spatial encoding, B1 coils have previously been shown to spatially encode, but they remain widely under-used and under-developed. The goal of this effort is to demonstrate the viability and expand upon the B1 imaging approach known as Frequency-modulated Rabi-Encoded Echoes (aka, FREE), specifically, frequency-encoded and phase-encoded FREE. FREE is unique from other B1 imaging approaches because of its high immunity to magnetic imperfections. FREE, unlike other approaches, can appropriately image in highly inhomogeneous (and inexpensive) magnets.

This proposed product and technology platform presents a new type of cleaner propulsion technology.The proposed electric drive works by accelerating electrons between closely spaced electrodes in a capacitor using electric fields generated by a battery.

Vectors, or organisms that transmit diseases to other organisms, like mosquitoes and ticks, have a significant impact on human health and agriculture, with associated mortality and morbidity. This project aims to advance artificial intelligence methods to identify mosquito species from high resolution images. While well studied and documented, mosquito species identification remains a highly skilled task, where the few capable of this skill for a given region often have many other job responsibilities, making time devoted to the laborious task of mosquito identification difficult to justify at scale, despite the necessity of the data created. This project and its derivative works will enable organizations without this skill in-house to acquire this highly valuable data. The solution will also allow organizations with this skill in-house to task shift identification to seasonal technicians, and field a larger dataset. This larger dataset would enable better decision making for the control of mosquito borne disease.If successful, these methodologies can be translated to other vectors for disease, further benefiting public health._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is centered around the problem of mosquito species identification. There are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes in the world, each with different behaviors and capacities for carrying disease. Regionally trained taxonomic experts can identify them through visual inspection, but there is a shortage of such experts. Some artificial intelligence (AI) methods for image-based identification have already been developed, but they are only designed for a limited number of species and face issues due to complex mosquito morphology and the variability incurred in practical use by vector control organizations. This project seeks to enhance existing methodologies for artificial intelligence (AI)-based insect identification by making use of generative models to address issues in training datasets caused by sampling biases. These models will be used to modulate the presence of underrepresented attributes to make a more robust and less biased model. The generative models used for this task will also be used to translate the data for viability in one constrained image domain to another. The final task is to use these models to modulate the training datasets for closely related mosquito species to fine tune performance for minute, but important, distinctions._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","award_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2482125"},{"firm":"QAS.AI INC.","award_title":"SBIR Phase II:An AI-Enhanced Angiographic System to Guide Endovascular Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms","agency":"NSF","branch":"","phase":"Phase II","program":"SBIR","agency_tracking_number":"2304388","contract":"2304388","proposal_award_date":"2023-10-01","contract_end_date":"2025-09-30","solicitation_number":"NSF 22-552","solicitation_year":"2022","topic_code":"AI","award_year":"2023","award_amount":"999862.00","duns":"","uei":"","hubzone_owned":"N","socially_economically_disadvantaged":"N","women_owned":"N","number_employees":"","company_url":"","address1":"701 Ellicott St","address2":"256","city":"Buffalo","state":"NY","zip":"14203","poc_name":"Mohammad Mahdi Shiraz Bhurwani","poc_title":"","poc_phone":"(786) 514-1283","poc_email":"mshirazb@buffalo.edu","pi_name":"Mohammad Mahdi Shiraz Bhurwani","pi_title":"","pi_phone":"(786) 514-1283","pi_email":"mshirazb@buffalo.edu","ri_name":null,"ri_poc_name":"","ri_poc_phone":"","abstract":"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is improving the surgical outcome for patients undergoing neuro-endovascular interventions for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs).

Most ruptured IA patients (~65%) die due to the initial bleed or its immediate complications. Of the survivors, ~50% are left disabled and dependent on others for daily activities.

Mounting consumer backlash against plastic waste, domestic and international regulations, and an increased focus on curtailing dependence on petroleum are driving the demand for compostable packaging solutions that can service the biodegradable packaging market which is set to grow to $812 billion by 2030. By using seaweed as an alternative feedstock, the team's goal is to eliminate the need for more environmentally intensive inputs including petroleum as well as other terrestrial crops. Furthermore, this material technology is being designed for compatibility with existing plastic manufacturing infrastructure \u2013 thereby streamlining a path to scale and cost competitiveness. The anticipated outcome of this project is the development of the first commercially viable polymeric material predominantly derived from seaweed, that is melt-processed and compostable. This breakthrough will unlock a renewable plastic replacement that meets essential requirements for cost, scalability, and environmental impact. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project focuses on the development of a viable pathway for creating melt-processable pellets from seaweed. The goal is to enable the conversion of these pellets using conventional machinery to produce flexible film packaging. The main technical challenge to overcome in achieving successful commercialization is that seaweed materials do not melt at suitable processing temperatures, as do traditional polymers. Consequently, the resulting material does not possess the necessary mechanical properties required for flexible packaging. To address this challenge, the team will explore the tempering of seaweed chemistry and associated materials with selected commercial compostable polymers. This approach aims to achieve comparable strain at break, tensile strength, and stiffness to conventional thin film packaging while ensuring home compostability.While previous research and applications have explored the use of seaweed for less economically viable film technologies, the unique contribution of this effort lies in combining varying seaweed chemistries and implementing them as a melt-processable seaweed material._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.","award_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2481807"},{"firm":"LUTRIS, INC.","award_title":"SBIR Phase I:Massively Parallel Protocols for Software-based Wireless Systems","agency":"NSF","branch":"","phase":"Phase I","program":"SBIR","agency_tracking_number":"2322307","contract":"2322307","proposal_award_date":"2023-09-15","contract_end_date":"2024-08-31","solicitation_number":"NSF 23-515","solicitation_year":"2023","topic_code":"IT","award_year":"2023","award_amount":"273383.00","duns":"","uei":"","hubzone_owned":"N","socially_economically_disadvantaged":"N","women_owned":"N","number_employees":"","company_url":"","address1":"1437 Hearst Ave","address2":"","city":"Berkeley","state":"CA","zip":"94702","poc_name":"James Martin","poc_title":"","poc_phone":"(510) 397-9274","poc_email":"james@lutris.us","pi_name":"James Martin","pi_title":"","pi_phone":"(510) 397-9274","pi_email":"james@lutris.us","ri_name":null,"ri_poc_name":"","ri_poc_phone":"","abstract":"The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to implement state-of-the-art radio communication systems faster and less expensively. Radio systems are an essential part of everyday life, serving roles from entertainment to public safety. But modern radio systems, designed to use the limited number of available frequencies efficiently, are expensive to develop and deploy. A major reason for the high cost is that custom silicon chips are needed to do the processing that converts a weak radio signal into useful data.This project aims to make radio systems much cheaper to build. Instead of building custom chips, the team uses commodity computers and specially designed software that can run the radio processing tasks at high speed. This speed is enabled by technology that analyzes radio processing tasks and turns them into software which runs on a processor with many individual computing cores.The economic impact is twofold: that technology can reduce the cost of existing systems, such as cellular LTE and 5G base stations, it also makes possible new applications which are too expensive to build from custom hardware._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project seeks to understand how to develop the processing needed in modern radio system quickly and efficiently.The team also seeks to address the features of communications protocols that are hard to implement because the computations are too complicated or too much data needs to be examined before the final output is generated.

The technology will measure the how fast key radio algorithms run on commodity computing hardware and how much time is spent on essential, but not productive, tasks such as moving data between memories.

As more CO2 has accumulated in the atmosphere trapping the sun\u2019s rays, Earth\u2019s temperature has continued to rise.

Through this hollow design, it not only saves on building costs, but may be poised to save on ongoing energy costs. Energy cost in a carbon capture contactor is a function of pressure drop or drag. The company's hypothesis is that a centrifuge is significantly more aerodynamic than the honeycomb-like filling currently used in contactors.The energy savings can translate into a system with significantly lower pressure drop and, therefore, lower ongoing energy costs to run.

To address global health problems, effective and safe new biologics such as therapeutics and vaccines will need to be manufactured at unprecedented large scales and short times. Accelerating access to new biologics for potentially billions of individuals will be critical for healthcare and the global economy. The solutions will be manifold, and realizing productive and robust manufacturing for these candidate preventative and therapeutic medicines in a short period of time remains a key challenge to transition discoveries from the lab to the clinic. The innovations proposed in this project could significantly accelerate drug development and biologics manufacturing by shortening the biologics development times up to six months. Vaccine and drug developers would succeed faster and fail faster, enabling accelerated transitions of discoveries for new therapeutics to the clinic and beyond by addressing critical steps in manufacturing. Improving transitions should also let developers test a higher number of compounds, thereby increasing the performance and potentially reducing the side effects of these drugs._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project aids in the manufacturing of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Manufacturing of biologics starts with a high-performing clonal cell-line, derived (by definition) from a single cell.

This essential step in any biologic manufacturing transition is critical time lost in the fight against disease. This project enables drug developers to select a high-performing cell clone in one day, compared to many months by using a proprietary, single-cell, proteomics platform at an unprecedented throughput rather than having to go through lengthy, iterative selection, clonal expansion and analytics. The scope of the research is focused on addressing the remaining critical technical hurdles before deploying the technology for commercial use.

This project is developing a process to manufacture a chemical known as FDCA (furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid) from carbon dioxide and a commodity feedstock made from inedible biomass. FDCA is a naturally occurring substance and is used to make polymers (i.e., plastics) that have superior performance compared to analogous polymers produced today from fossil fuel feedstocks. The obstacle to producing these polymers is that it has been complicated and prohibitively expensive to produce FDCA. The competing technologies for making FDCA require edible sugar as the feedstock and a very large number of process steps, resulting in high manufacturing costs. This project proposes to produce this chemical using a dramatically simplified process, which enables cost-competitive production. By advancing the technology toward commercial application, this project will have a far-reaching impact on US economic competitiveness and innovation in the chemical industry. With a secure FDCA supply, US chemical and materials companies can develop manufacturing capacity for polymers with an ultimate market opportunity of greater thangreater than$100 billion. In addition, replacing energy- and emissions-intensive fossil fuel-derived polymers with these more environmentally friendly polymers will reduce emissions of multiple economic sectors.

The reaction under investigation is the aerobic oxidation of furfural to furan-2-carboxylate (furoate) under aqueous alkaline conditions. Oxidizing furfural under industrially relevant conditions (high concentration and high rates) is fundamentally challenging because furfural is prone to rapid degradation processes. Studies of the process in the earlier Phase I project provided key insights into the reaction mechanism and identified two potential reactor designs for continuous operation.

The unique process combines two technical improvements for supercritical CO2 (scCO2) based drying of wet substrates that together (i) dramatically increase water loading uptake in scCO2 and (ii) significantly reduce the scCO2 repressurization cost on regeneration prior to recycle.    Preliminary economic estimates suggest as much as an order of magnitude reduction in energy cost can be achieved due to both sensible and latent heat savings.  Further, the higher water loadings coupled with reduced scCO2 regeneration penalty yield a smaller package size relative to traditional supercritical fluid drying approaches and hence reduced capital cost.  Finally, GHG and other hazardous emissions consistent with traditional high temperature evaporative drying are dramatically reduced and substrate drying damage is minimized.  Combining these various direct and indirect cost savings, the proposed approach represents a potentially new paradigm in wet substrate drying, applicable to tens of thousands of products in a wide array of industries to displace the conventional process that consumes over 10 Quad per year, worldwide.

This substitution effort will assist the USA in reaching net-zero GHG emissions by saving over 660 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) or CO2-equivalent gases by 2050. Replacing synthetic leathers made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polyurethane (PU) or hide-based leather with bacterial cellulose will have significant environmental benefits. Being petroleum-based, PVC and PU production has significant GHG emissions. Genuine leather requires transport of hides to tanneries, most of which are no longer located in the USA.Additionally, the water-intensive tanning and dyeing processes produce toxic wastes. In contrast, growth and processing of bacterial cellulose produces little to no toxic waste and few GHG emissions. Further, the material is biodegradable (unlike PVC or PU), which is appealing to consumers in the rapidly growing market for vegan leather. Scale-up of the production to replace plastics worldwide with this sustainable material will reduce trash generation and alleviate the problem of plastic waste in the environment. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enhance the properties of the existing synthetic leather materials and will develop the technology to produce large quantities of the material at low cost.

The material looks, feels, and performs like real leather having desirable properties such as suppleness, sew-ability, and high tensile strength. The initial focus will be on creating a vegan leather alternative consisting of multiple cellulose sheets combined using a proprietary formulation. This project will enable the refinement of the material to meet industry standards for durability (e.g., water resistance, flex resistance, abrasion resistance, colorfastness) and aesthetics (color and patterns) and will develop the processes for producing the material at a commercial scale to meet market demand for quantity and price. Further, the fast-growing bacterial strains provide a competitive advantage for scale-up.

First applications include material additions to repair gouges and mis-drilled holes during aircraft production and service, both of which represent significant financial opportunities. Repairs to the structural material are not currently permissible in a production environment due to adverse effects of currently available repair methods on base material properties, usually due to extreme temperatures. Aerostructure manufacturers have a strong incentive to minimize the weight of the aircraft structure, often at the significant financial and environmental expense of scrapping a whole panel. Maintenance, repair and overhaul often entails total replacement of damaged components with new ones as improper repairs of critical components can cause catastrophic harm. Replacement of parts is expensive and has long lead times due to high-value, low-volume nature of the aerospace industry. This project will develop an effective restoration method to repair of metallic components, while being agnostic to the material and part geometry. Reclamation of previously unrepairable parts made from materials such as titanium, nickel, and aluminum has a large positive environmental impact.Additionally, by broadly enabling solid-state joining, this technology will disrupt the welding industry, globally valued at $20 billion.

Here, electrically vaporized metallic foils will be used as the driver for the fill elements and the research will focus on whether those elements can be launched reproducibly to develop large bond areas and reproducible positioning. The ability to control element shape and orientation during flight and produce an interface that is fully welded are the most high-risk aspects of the technology. Mechanical testing, scanning electron microscopy, and inline process monitoring such as photonic Doppler velocimetry will be performed.
