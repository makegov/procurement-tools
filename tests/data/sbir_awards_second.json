The use of people’s biometrics, internet traffic, and financial, medical, and genetic data can enable better crime prevention, targeted ads, and health innovation, but at the expense of privacy. Data may also be too sensitive to be given to third parties. The immediate impact of adopting this technology will be greater security for sensitive image data with easier access to useful inferences. The solution will shift the paradigm of institutions storing sensitive data onsite to one in which even sensitive data is stored and accessed in the cloud. With the capability of private outsourced data analysis will come a marketplace for computational tasks, including machine learning as a service, that will spur research and deliver better results to patients and clients faster and without risk of exposure._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will adapt existing Deep Neural Network models to use a fully homomorphic encryption scheme to perform image classification on encrypted images. The primary challenge is to reduce the computational overhead of operations on encrypted data to make the scheme practical at desired levels of accuracy and security. The proposed research and development addresses this challenge through innovation in machine learning, computational number theory, approximation theory, and computer science. The goal of the proposed research and development is to demonstrate the commercial viability of secure image recognition by achieving a reasonable level of security, accuracy, and server cost. The team will experiment in training and testing modified convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification using carefully chosen activation functions and/or approximations to the testing function, and simultaneously building onto existing homomorphic encryption libraries new functionality to compute these operations homomorphically._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the benefits of next-generation X-ray imaging systems. The proposed single-shot platform overcomes the current barriers to widespread commercialization of Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) X-ray imaging. If successful, the single-shot technology will enable the development and application of next generation X-ray imagers for detecting liquids, small explosives, and other security threats for aviation and business applications. Reducing false alarm rates at airports will increase customer satisfaction, improve security, and reduce cost. DPC imaging could also substantially increase the detection of food pests, thereby reducing food waste and saving billions of dollars. In another market, non-destructive testing could significantly improve the inspection of additive manufacturing products, reducing manufacturing time through fewer iterations and creating high-quality products. Medical DPC imagers would provide MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)-like resolution and diagnostics at an order of magnitude lower cost than current MRI._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a deep-learning approach to realize “single-shot” X-ray phase-contrast imaging. To commercialize the technology, the deep-learning algorithm needs to identify more complicated real-world objects effectively and accurately. Deep-learning methods require thousands to millions of training samples to make a reliable model. However, no imaging library for this unique technology currently exists. The research and development plan initially incorporates the standard slow scanning method of X-ray phase-contrast imaging to obtain DPC tri-signature computed tomography (CT) images. The tri-signature CT images provide the basis for precise material characterization (e.g., absorption coefficients, indices of refraction, and scatter characteristics). Once the materials have been characterized, they form the basis for creating millions of numerical representations of real-world objects. These objects subsequently form the core for effectively and efficiently training deep-learning models without further experimentation._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop refined approaches to power system dynamic stability assessments, enabling the efficient, mass integration of renewable energy into systems worldwide. Decarbonization goals and economic opportunity necessitate the increase of inverter-based resources, such as solar, wind, and battery energy storage. A dynamic stability assessment is required before the interconnection of every renewable, inverter-based resource on all power systems. Current simulation approaches do not capture the critical details of inverter operation or are too computationally complex and expensive to be effective with real-world systems. This results in the enormous potential for unique simulation capabilities that streamline this process. There is a global market opportunity for more effective and efficient planning solutions that enable power system operators to meet this need. In the United States, alone, the licensing opportunity for a solution is hundreds of millions of dollars. The proposed hybrid approach combines computational flexibility with _x000D_\naccuracy. This solution will leverage the maturity of these approaches and eliminate their weaknesses. The final solution will yield an invaluable, novel simulation tool for power system operators and planners navigating the challenges of the energy transition._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project results from the development of mathematical methods that will comprise the foundation of this hybrid power system dynamics simulation tool. Existing tools have clear weaknesses. For example, reduced-order, phasor domain simulation approaches do not capture the critical aspects of inverter operation. Detailed waveform domain approaches are sufficient to capture relevant dynamics but are too computationally expensive to be effective with real-world systems. These domains are mature, but separately they do not meet the changing need. Hybridizing them in a single platform is a solution, but it requires research in the following three foundational pillars of the proposed tool: 1) autonomous boundary determination – identifying the spatial (across the network) and temporal (across the simulation length) boundary that partitions the two simulation domains; 2) intra-simulation model order adjustment – applying dynamical model granularity for all simulations, but singularly perturbing the differential systems to create algebraic relations and reduce computational burden when substantial detail is not required; and 3) seamless simulation mode switching – identifying criteria necessary for switching between domains. With the successful completion of this SBIR Phase I project, the viability of the hybrid approach will be confirmed, and a roadmap for implementation will be realized._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These mechanisms include ionization between fuel ions and neutral background atoms, particle scattering collisions to the device walls and Bremsstrahlung X-ray radiation losses. Once these mechanisms are correlated with the PIC code, detailed assessments of the simulated fusion plasma will be made to determine the potential Q of a future small-scale fusion reactor for energy production.This gain in understanding will enable development of solutions to mitigate loss mechanisms in future prototypes to maximize Q for small net energy fusion devices._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a dynamic geospatial database that can be mined to further develop precision models of soil moisture and farm productivity that will aid small- to medium-sized farms. These farms cover almost 75% of the operating farmland in the U.S. Large companies in the agriculture industry benefit from the collection of digital farm data however, smaller farms are disadvantaged by the inaccessibility of agricultural digital innovation systems. The availability of timely digital information as inputs to field conditions will help small- to mid-sized farmers optimize their yields and potentially generate greater revenue. The proposed database will integrate multiscale and multivariate imaging and non-imaging geospatial and meteorological data into a single source. The merging of satellite-based geospatial data with airborne-geospatial data, a challenging task, will improve the accuracy of earth science data. Potential applications of the technology include medium- to long-term food security planning, drought mitigation, soil conservation, diversification, and expansion of climate-resilient and sustainable farming._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing an integrated, one-source, dynamic geospatial database as well as precision soil moisture and farm productivity forecasting models to benefit small- and medium-size farms.

The proposed project aims to challenge this existing tradeoff and produce CPU heat sinks that can maintain 3X computational performance ‘sprints’ with no added weight/volume nor electrical energy expenditure, in a scalable and easily deployable, drop-in form factor. Fueled by a global demand for high-performance computing, internet-of-things, and handheld electronics, the market for high-performance CPU coolers is rising with a market size of about $2.04 billion and a compound annual growth rate of 3.73-4.64% over the next decade.The target solid-solid TES heatsink is transferable to battery fast charging, system-on-chip devices, and the power electronic market._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project resides in newly-identified thermal energy storage materials to shift the paradigm in CPU cooler design away from simply maximizing steady-state heat dissipation towards an optimized approach that combines high steady-state dissipation with high-capacity thermal storage.This Phase I project has three primary research objectives: i) develop analytical and numerical topology optimization approaches to identify ideal thermal energy storage material properties and composite heat transfer/capacity structures for CPU applications: ii) leverage data-driven shape memory alloy discovery using an artificial intelligence framework to identify and ultimately arc-melt new thermal energy storage materials that exhibit high-latent heat, high-conductivity, low hysteresis, and/or the ideal combination of material properties based on CPU requirements: and iii) design, fabricate, and test prototypes for model validation and concept demonstration.

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will improve clinical outcomes for the thousands of patients globally who undergo craniofacial repair surgery each year. Facial disfigurement, whether congenital or acquired, can have profound physical and psychosocial implications including altered body image, reduced quality of life, and poor societal integration.Fat grafting is one of the most rapidly growing procedures in facial reconstructive surgery due to its lack of reliance on foreign or synthetic materials, safe harvest, and minimal surgical risk. While fat grafting has potential to make groundbreaking strides in facial reconstruction, the technique is held back by unreliable volume and shape loss. Craniofacial repairs are particularly challenging for surgeons given the requirement for exquisite control of graft shape and volume. The product supported by this proposal has the capacity to dramatically improve the shape, volume, and survivability of grafted fat. This technology has the potential to not only provide a novel and innovative option for clinicians facing challenging craniofacial cases, but success in this beachhead market will also support the rapidly growing utility of fat grafting in other procedures such as breast reconstruction, amputation site bulking, and hand/foot pad repair. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe proposed project is focused on the development and commercialization of a recombinant, protein-based biopolymer engineered from human elastin to enhance the use of fat grafting in craniofacial reconstruction. This product is one of the first materials to make use of a new paradigm in understanding protein engineering: that highly disordered proteins with defined 3D structure play key roles in the mechanical and biological activity of the body. Using iterative design and molecular engineering of specific protein ordered and disordered domains, the team has generated a new class of biomaterials that are uniquely suited to meet the key criteria for a fat grafting support matrix including: (1) a temperature-dependent phase transition from a liquid to a moldable solid at body temperature, (2) a porous matrix that allows cellular infiltration and supports long-term viability of the tissue in vivo as well as the vascularization required for tissue viability, and (3) enhanced protein stability that allows simple use at the point-of-care with minimal modification to current clinical practice. This Phase II project will focus on core needs for scale-up, toxicity studies, biocompatibility, and large animal efficacy evaluations in preparation for regulatory submission, clinical evaluation, and commercial approval._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A key discriminator of the innovation employs a novel wearable sensor capable of capturing bioimpedance measurements tailored to the unique physiological characteristics of each athlete for personalized safety. Coupled with deep learning methods and cloud-based analytics, the wearable system could send early alert messages to the athletic staff before an athlete approaches adverse or life-threatening conditions. The commercial potential will provide the sports science community with novel insights to customize player activities, manage rest periods, and adjust athlete hydration behaviors.

Acute water loss (dehydration) during sports participation induced by long-term exposure to hot and humid conditions leads to adverse health conditions. Dehydration impacts an athlete’s health in four critical areas: cardiovascular stress, cognitive impairment, thermoregulation failure, and heat stroke. Limitations of current field-based methods include the use of manual (e.g., weight charts) or invasive assessments (e.g., urine tests). The company's fully integrated wearable sensor performs bioimpedance spectroscopy for non-invasive, real-time hydration monitoring. Continuous measurements generate a bioimpedance profile unique to each athlete that captures the fluctuations from the extracellular water and intracellular water compartments. Thisinnovation will give athletic trainers insight into their athletes’ safety, health, and performance. Phase II objectives include: 1) building the cloud-based platform, 2) advancing the functionality and sensitivity of the wearable sensor, and 3) deploying the proprietary deep learning algorithms to the cloud for large-scale monitoring.

UTIs are one the most common causes of a healthcare visit for women in the United States and represent one of largest sources of antibiotic prescriptions in the country. Untreated UTIs can lead to severe complications for the patient, including systemic bacterial infections such as bacteremia. Despite the severity and prevalence of UTIs, diagnostic methodologies remain extremely time-consuming and rely on antiquated, culture-based methodologies for pathogen detection. This time-intensive diagnostic workflow typically leaves women in pain for up to three days before they are prescribed the appropriate antibiotic therapy.As a result of shortcomings in current healthcare workflows, women who have limited access to care are subject to longer result wait times, and often never receive the appropriate treatment. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project utilizes a novel nanosensor embedded into an integrated diagnostic consumable for rapid detection of target nucleic acid sequences directly from patient samples. The consumable is coupled to a proprietary bench-top readout instrument for test analysis and result reporting at the point-of-care. The technology eliminates the need for bacterial culture and nucleic acid amplification through an ultrasensitive optical detection modality, providing species-level information and genotypic antibiotic resistance data within minutes. Applications of the proposed platform translate beyond UTIs to other clinical scenarios that currently employ lengthy culture-based or amplification-based diagnostic workflows, such as sexually transmitted infections and respiratory infections. Successful product commercialization will require meeting clinically actionable timescales and assay performance benchmarks. Of importance is the development of a simple, integrated workflow for healthcare workers to enable single-step operation at the point-of-care.The Phase II technical objectives focus on the development and pilot-scale fabrication of the nanosensor, the optimization of sensitivity and robustness of data analysis methodologies to inform down-selection of reader optical hardware, and system integration and user testing._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from its potential to treat arthritis in joints. This research will be the first investigation into the use of liquid-crystal elastomers (LCEs) for joint repair to treat hallux rigidus. Hallux rigidus (HR) is a joint disorder at the base of the big toe affecting approximately 2.5% of people over 50 years old and roughly 2-3 million people in the US.It is the second most common condition for the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. If successful, this LCE-based MTP joint implant would advance the standard of care in treating joint degeneration and open the way for novel uses of LCEs in the body. The unique nature of LCEs will permit devices to mimic the natural tissues in the body and provide anatomically correct support. In addition to LCE's ability to mimic the MTP joint, other potential advantages may lead to the advancement of patient-specific devices such as treatments for arthritis in other joints in the foot, hand, knee (e.g., total knee replacement), and spine (e.g., total disc replacement). Other soft tissue applications include osteochondral defects (OCD) and the repair of any load-bearing orthopedic tissue such as meniscus._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe proposed project focuses on developing, verifying and validating, and commercializing an LCE-based cartilage replacement device for the MTP joint to treat hallux rigidus. LCEs have superior energy dissipation properties relative to traditional elastomers such as silicone or hydrogels. This proposal seeks to demonstrate how LCEs can be used to treat degenerated joints by combining the fields of liquid-crystal elastomers, rheology, and bioengineering. LCEs are known for their unique behavior which is similar to biological tissues. This project will be accomplished through several main research objectives to support and accelerate the research and development effort: completion of the device pilot production, verification and validation, development of surgical kits and procedures for the device, and transfer of the technology into high volume manufacturing for the commercial device launch._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "There is a critical need for electrification of transportation systems. The proposed technology enables the development of very high-power density permanent magnet motors, which when coupled to an integrated SiC drive allows for an overall specific power beyond 12 kW/kg. The proposed concept relies on the tight integration of a high-power density dual-rotor permanent magnet motor, high power density SiC power converters and a shared closed loop cooling system rejecting the heat in the propulsion ducted fan air stream. The proposed motor is based on a dual-rotor configuration using permanent magnets forming ideal Halbach arrays allowing for high magnetic loading without the need for iron. The permanent magnet rotors are based on “continuous flux directed” magnets (PM-360™) currently under development at AML and an air-gap stator with direct liquid cooling allowing for high electric loading and unprecedented specific torque and specific power. The heat is removed by a closed loop of liquid shared by the motor and power converter. The heat is rejected in the propulsion air stream. The integration of the motor and power converter will help to achieve very high-power density which is paramount in aircraft application. A high efficiency three-level SiC inverter will be developed with high switching frequency (>25kHz). By adoption of SiC device with the proposed intelligent gate driver technology as well as multi-level topology with active surge voltage canceler, the inverter can be integrated into the motor enclosure.",

        "abstract": "Cryo-compressed hydrogen (CcH2) offers a thermodynamic optimum for high-density, low-cost storage as a key element in achieving economical hydrogen infrastructure. Verne is developing a cryo-compressor technology platform that will convert gaseous hydrogen (GH2) at low pressures (e.g. 20 bar) and 300 K, to CcH2 (60 – 80 K and 300 – 500 bar). These systems provide hydrogen with liquid-like densities with half the energy intensity and at smaller scales relative to liquefaction. This new approach to hydrogen densification disrupts existing infrastructure as it decouples high-density hydrogen from a liquid hydrogen infrastructure. In this work, Verne will further build upon its process modeling work, and will carry out a first-of-kind demonstration for the catalyst-filled heat exchanger of the cryo-compressor. The integration of a high-pressure hydrogen heat exchanger (300 bar), coolant cycle, and ortho-para hydrogen catalyst is a formidable technical challenge. Previous work has focused on low-pressure (typically   20 bar) systems and typically require separate steps for cooling and the exothermic ortho–para (nuclear spin isomers) H2 conversion. Verne proposes to couple cooling and ortho–para conversion in a single system. Conversion of GH2 to CcH2 at small scale (less than 50 kg day) will be demonstrated for the first time. The heat exchanger design, flow rates, and operating protocols will be optimized and empirically probed. Benefits of a CcH2 infrastructure will be highlighted, such as fast fills, and dispensing into a CcH2 storage system will be carried out. If successful, this work will validate cryo-compressors as a way to decentralize high-density hydrogen, and accelerate deployment and utilization of electrolysis and the broader hydrogen infrastructure of the United States and globally.\r\n",

        "abstract": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a machine learning-enabled medical record summarization tool designed to provide a narrative summary that can aid physicians in patient care. On average, physicians spend just 3 minutes reviewing a patient’s medical record, and during this time they must interpret unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) that can make it difficult for physicians to identify information essential to patient care and diagnosis. By targeting the rich clinical data embedded in unstructured clinical notes, the proposed tool could provide clinically relevant information and a contextual understanding of a patient’s medical history. If successful, the proposed solution will reduce the data burden placed on doctors, mitigate the risk of missing valuable information that could affect patient diagnosis or lead to costly medical errors, and maximize downstream effects on patient outcomes. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to leverage advances in natural language processing (NLP) to assist doctors by automating the process of electronic health record review. The underlying innovation is an extractive-abstractive pipeline that determines what content in the medical record is the most salient and should be summarized through a transformer (a machine learning model). This project aims to advance this summarization tool to more challenging use cases, primarily summarizing the outpatient record, a task made challenging by the large scope of the data, clinical redundancies, different data structures, and sources inherent to outpatient data, all of which need to be accounted for in model training and validation. Objectives include to 1) developing an outpatient summarization model and demonstrating the ability to produce summaries that semantically match reference text with a high level of fluency, 2) validating the utility of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated outpatient summaries to provide significant value to physicians, 3) evaluating the ability of AI-generated summaries that provide information relevant to future patient visit through ablation study, and 4) incorporating checks for bias in the existing model._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that by improving the success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF), this project will benefit assisted reproduction technology (ART) providers, infertile couples, and insurance companies. With infertility increasing globally, there is a huge potential market for ART services. However, current IVF technologies provide inadequate results and come with high costs that significantly impact both the minority of infertile couples who can afford IVF and the majority for whom the technology is priced out of reach. The successful development of a disposable, low-cost platform automating all steps of IVF is expected to produce a manifold increase in the productivity of ART clinics by reducing the processing time demands on andrologists and embryologists as well as reducing the labor requirements for sperm separation. This will, in turn, have the effect of increasing the efficiency, capacity and profitability of ART clinics, while lowering overall costs of IVF. Lower prices will reduce the burden on couples using ART and on their insurance companies, while increasing access to ART for lower-income populations. The technology is also expected to result in higher fertilization rates, enhancing successful IVF conception outcomes._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an IVF-on-a-chip platform in response to the need for a cost-effective and highly controlled IVF process. Variance in operator skill levels and damage to gametes due to handling contribute to significant variability in IVF performance, with success rates averaging only around 37%. The new technology aims to remove this inconsistency by using a microfluidic platform to perform the entire IVF process in a single-chip workflow, automating and optimizing sperm selection, sperm capacitation, and egg fertilization. The proposed platform includes a region for sperm selection, a reservoir for sperm capacitation, and a segment for egg fertilization. This project will develop a single user-friendly commercial device and optimize conditions for each step of the IVF process with bovine gametes, through rigorous analysis and optimization of the timing, flow, incubation, and media conditions. The device will be tested in mice and bovine models as a precursor to human treatment and its performance compared to traditional IVF. If successful, the fully developed platform system will fulfill the need for a simple-to-use, affordable, robust, and high-throughput sperm sample preparation for medical treatments and clinical applications, resulting in higher fertilization rates and enhanced patient outcomes._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to validate a new, biochar-enriched building material as a ceiling tile product. The plane of ceiling tiles represents a vast, untapped opportunity in combating climate change through carbon sequestration. With the innovation, a proprietary mineral matrix is enriched with 50-80% biochar. Biochar is the resulting charcoal-like residue frompyrolysis.This stabilized form of carbon is nearly crystalline and resistant to emissions-causing oxidation. Combined with a proprietary mineral binder, the resulting novel material is non-flammable, ultra lightweight, and biodegradable. As a ceiling tile, it can reduce a building’s embodied carbon in an easily quantifiable way, position the building for carbon sink remuneration, boost the green ratings of the building, help qualify a building for sustainability-linked financing - all without compromising on fire safety standards. This project capacitates an innovation that adds to the nation's toolkit in creating a climate-responsible built environment._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe project innovation is a novel, biogenic, cementitious chemistry composed of plant-based biochar, clay, binding minerals, proprietary catalysts, optional reinforcement fibers and optional pigments. The inclusion of biochar is a major characteristic of the innovation, comprising up to 80% of the material. Unlike carbon stored in plant matter, the ocean or in soil, the carbon atoms of biochar are more resistant to losing electrons and being converted into carbon dioxide, therefore making the innovation a novel solution towards converting the built environment into a \"carbon bank\".There are three major questions to resolve: how could varying biochar particle sizes impact tile integrity, can the innovation perform satisfactorily in standard tile dimensions amidst different ambient humidity levels, and can the tiles achieve the Class A fire standard of competing tiles. The iterative experimental protocols will utilize the classic American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) tests used to demonstrate building code compliance in all three of these research areas._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The core technology of this technology is an online platform for creating and delivering high-quality assessments that are auto-graded by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, providing immediate feedback to students. The technology provides students with the opportunity to practice questions in a personalized environment until mastery is achieved. The auto-grading features reduce grading effort, allowing instructors to focus on course design, incorporate more frequent and second-chance testing, and have more time to directly help students. The platform can automatically generate and grade personalized assessments for each student, which helps to minimize cheating and enables repeated practice by students. This learning experience is suited to help minorities, first-generation college students, and students of low socioeconomic status, who have traditionally had less access to the highest quality human instructors. Making STEM education more effective will facilitate the creation and continuing support of a highly educated STEM workforce and is important for national competitiveness in related fields._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Phase I project aims to develop a no-code, graphical authoring environment that will allow instructors without prior programming experience to create AI-based auto-graded content.

With the development and commercialization of the technology proposed here, this team will address the scalability, cost, and inconsistency issues in order to: 1) speed up the transition to advanced manufacturing approaches (continuous manufacturing), 2) facilitate the re-shoring of drug manufacturing, contributing to addressing the national security challenge of American dependence on foreign drug manufacturers, and 3) reduce drug production costs, which will eventually lead to cheaper drugs for the benefit of the entire population. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative, continuous crystallization device that is scalable, provides adequate and effective movement of solids, and provides high-quality crystalline products, thus fulfilling an unmet need in the pharmaceutical market and in the technical community. The novel design aims to solve the problem of moving solids (crystals) effectively while providing well-controlled flow characteristics with an approach that is scalable from lab to production. This technology uses a combination of several original features to provide a new technological approach to address these transport challenges. This team will first provide a demonstration of the ability to transport slurries with plug flow characteristics. Then, the team will demonstrate the crystallization of a pharmaceutical, benchmarking it against standard batch crystallization methods. Once the technology has been shown to function well in these conditions, the device will be scaled up, in order to be tested and used at production scale. Once complete, the commercialized device is expected to be able to overcome problems with other technologies, including issues of transport, uniformity, consistency, reproducibility, and cost, making this novel device a key player in the future of pharmaceutical manufacturing._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project comes through the development of a prototype software modeling technology and associated monitoring methodology that will be used to transform the value proposition of farm-based practices that improve soil carbon sequestration. The solution enables verification of high-quality carbon offsets, provides feedback regarding important agronomic metrics, and can be applied on a large and geographically expansive scale. Specifically, this prototype is tailored to a novel species of hybridized grass planted as a sustainable, carbon-sequestering cover crop in specialty cropping systems. The solution's agronomic value proposition will enable farming operations to play a part in climate change mitigation while also improving profitability. This innovation will apply to millions of acres of specialty crop farms throughout the country, where cover cropping is currently underutilized despite environmental benefits. The solution will encourage a higher rate of adoption of the practice, lowering strain on farming budgets and natural resources. Additionally, the technology prototype will be applicable to other sustainable, land-based, carbon removal practices, extending its value-added potential to a wide variety of farming practices and circumstances._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a machine-learning based, multi-output modeling software system to quantifying soil carbon sequestration associated with specified farming practices and other important agronomic metrics. The farming practice modeled by this prototype is a hybridized, perennial, cool-season grass planted in specialty cropping systems as a cover crop. Cover cropping is paired with the practice of no-till to enable on-farm soil carbon sequestration, which is quantified by the software modeling prototype for third party verification. Inputs for the models come from a combination of remote and in situ monitored data, such as soil and biomass sample analysis, drone-captured multispectral imagery, and satellite imagery. The quantity and type of model inputs is determined by several factors, including the scalability of monitoring costs, their effect on the accuracy of the models, and the requirements of third-party protocols for verifying soil carbon models. Project tasks include the calibration of the monitoring methodology for new target variables, the addition of plant water status and plant nitrogen status models to a soil carbon model, and the delivery of a functional and scalable prototype capable of generating accurate predictive models of environmental changes attributed to the aforementioned cover crop._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of new therapies for rare diseases in children.An estimated 350 million people worldwide - half of which are children - suffer from an estimated 7,000+ known rare diseases annually, yet 95% of rare diseases still lack treatment. Even though greater than80% of rare diseases are genetic in origin, there have been relatively few actual drug discoveries. This is an enormous problem as 30% of children with rare diseases will not live to see their 5th birthdays. To address this, drug development can be accelerated by screening investigational drugs against micro-organs (“organoids”) that resemble young organs and have the same gene mutations as the patients. In a simple petri dish, organoids enable the direct study of the relationship between a patient’s genes and his/her disease.Such organoids present an opportunity to rapidly identify new disease mechanisms and targeted therapies. The team is scaling organoid technology into an automated drug development platform that is high throughput, robust, and applicable to multiple genetic diseases in children. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project advances drug development for pediatric rare diseases by accomplishing two primary objectives: (1) automated heart, liver, and brain organoid derivation from human stem cells, and (2) automated machine learning (ML) detection of disease in organoids derived from patients with genetic diseases affecting any of these three organs. To do this, a combination of robotics and specific protocols will differentiate tissue- and disease-specific organoids under standardized conditions. The organoids are monitored with microscopy as they transition between tissue state. The ML model learns what healthy organoids look like and uses that information to identify when an organoid exhibits a disease phenotype. These objectives are important for reducing batch-to-batch organoid variability and human error that can confound drug discovery efforts. In these same organoid models, drug screening and development will be performed to try to reverse or retard the disease phenotype unique to each disease. The result of this research will be the production of organoids with high accuracy and precision, as well as an automated means for detecting changes in heart, liver, and neural organoids that will be essential for finding new therapies._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for the universal availability of communications, especially in places where traditional communication methods are compromised or unavailable.Global tension, vulnerability of communication satellites, an increase in the frequency of natural disasters, physical barriers, and human space exploration make resilient communications more important than ever. Since matter is practically invisible to gravitational waves (GWs), such waves can transmit information through a planet or turbulent atmosphere without requiring relay satellites. In the coming decade, components of a coherent gravitational wave communication system have the potential to address these challenges and deliver foundational technology for other advanced applications such as ground based orbital cleanup, planet and planetoid matter composition analysis, asteroid deflection, and wireless energy transfer systems to name a few._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon research that shows dynamic source mass configurations can change the local gravitational field in regimes detectable by current technology. By improving the gravitational field detector’s sensitivity, implementing fine grained control of local changes in the gravitational field, and comprehensively isolating the system from non-gravitational influences, an improved characterization of induced gravitational field changes may be developed. These advances could lead to improved research tools and methods that are a pathway to the development of future system configurations that generate coherent gravitational waves. This research is an essential step toward directly or indirectly transmitting and receiving modulated information by a resilient gravitational communication system._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "This broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop membrane solutions to address opportunities in the gas and vapor separation market. Today, this market is dominated by energy-intensive thermal processes that have large carbon footprints, such as distillation and absorption/stripping. The current membrane solutions often lack the flux, recovery, and stability required for many applications. The membranes that will be developed in this project are formed from novel polymeric materials that have the highest combinations of permeability and selectivity out of all polymers reported in the open literature. If deployed commercially for renewable and/or traditional natural gas purification, these membranes could reduce energy consumption and product loss by over 40% and over 80%, respectively, compared to current commercial membranes. In this way, the advanced membranes being developed could save up to $2 million per day in product loss that is currently flared from commercial membrane systems, resulting in both savings for the customer and a reduced environmental footprint. Related opportunities in other gas and vapor separation markets could also be enabled by this research._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to develop gas separation membranes from a novel class of polymers with record performance. To this end, this effort aims to scale polymer synthesis, form thin films, test developed membranes using complex gas mixtures, and develop an optimized techno-economic model for market applications. These objectives are of practical importance for manufacturing and commercialization, but they are likewise important for scientific and technical innovation in polymer science and thin-film formation. Moreover, testing these materials in thin film form under complex gas mixtures will provide data on stability under relevant conditions. The research on polymer scaleup and thin film formation is critical for refining technoeconomic assumptions for capital costs, and the testing of complex gas mixtures is critical for refining assumptions on process energy costs and cost savings from product recovery. Accomplishment of these objectives will enable new innovations related to the formation of membrane modules that can be tested and evaluated with industrial gas mixtures._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Approximately 5.7 million U.S. children between the ages 5-12 are diagnosed with a mental health condition, with an additional 20-60% suspected of being undiagnosed. Despite the importance of early intervention, only about 20% of these children receive treatment. Barriers to care, including access and affordability, become even more glaring in rural areas and in low income and communities of color. Innovative smartphone solutions can reach parenting adults from all backgrounds, as 85% of adults in the U.S. own a smartphone. This project offers an innovative, affordable, and accessible digital parenting solution, built by psychologists, educators, and developmental specialists, that seeks to close the child mental healthcare equity gap, in line with the NSF’s mission. Reduction solutions need to be prioritized to give children a chance at growing into healthy adults. _x000D__x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe goal of the project is to build a parent coaching app, for parenting adults of children ages 5-12 years, that can tailor the content it delivers based on the specific physical, mental, social, and emotional needs of each child and parent. The key technical innovation at the heart of the app is its adaptive algorithms, which allow it to tailor the content journey based on a myriad of inputs. This core technology includes algorithms that deliver developmentally appropriate content suited for each unique family. In addition, the technology allows the app to detect when a higher level of care is needed and provides parents with education on seeking support. Integrating algorithms that track variable input allow the content to change over time, becoming more relevant and effective for evolving needs. This phase of research will be longitudinal and will include a significant sample size of parenting adult users in an effort to examine the functionality and positive impacts of the app, as well as to prepare the app for commercial launch in terms of scalability and security._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to produce high-quality (accurate/high-resolution) soil maps for agronomists and farmers at scale. Accurate soil information is a fundamental driver of better, more-efficient crop/soil management. This new branch of technology will deliver developed map products across various cropping systems that exist in the continental U.S., intersecting economic and environmental sustainability.Making site-specific soil fertility mapping information accessible to a diversity of land stewards is the goal of this project. Expected outcomes include more environmentally responsible farm management and manure and nutrient-management planning, precision farming, land use planning, planting decisions, evaluating stressors on plants, field conditioning, crop rotation, and prediction/interpretation of yields. Other benefits are increased farm profitability and increased soil health. This technology will result in increased crop yield while allowing for decreased input costs, leading to higher profitability in an industry that chronically suffers from low profit margins. The anticipated project outcomes meet NSF goals by advancing science, improving the lives and health of U.S. citizens, and potentially generating increased tax revenues and jobs via increased farm success._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis innovative technology has three components that differentiate it from the best current technologies used to produce maps of essential soil nutrients. The first is applying generalized landscape quantification to drive optimal soil sample collection accommodating landscape variability, thereby eliminating the need to collect unnecessary soil samples. The second component leverages advanced machine-learning algorithms that are able to use the small number of uniquely collected soil samples to produce accurate predictions. Finally, the technology is a transferable model that does not necessitate additional hardware to achieve its results. As envisioned, this technology can select appropriate covariate mosaics to capture relevant soil variability irrespective of cropping system and management practices. The scope of this project will be beneficial to row cropping system across the U.S., specifically targeting corn-soy, potatoes, wheat, and cotton production. Unlike currently available methods that produce inadequate data for challenging (cost-prohibitive) mapping targets, this new technology will render those targets accessible and cost-effective with reliable accuracies._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This technology enables municipal solid waste to be managed in a decentralized manner, avoiding the expense and negative environmental impacts of long-distance transportation. The zero-fuel Phoenix is very cost effective as the only inputs are water, filtration media, and labor to operate the machine. Amortizing the cost of the machine over 4 years, waste disposal cost is estimated at $20/ton which is half the cost of the cheapest landfill tipping fees in the US. Heat from the water scrubber can be utilized to generate 106.7 KWe of electricity, with a potential 5 to 10-fold increase if utilizing direct heat from the furnace. The ash byproduct has beneficial reuse as a construction material or soil amendment. Glass and metal are not destroyed by the process and can be retrieved from the ash chamber for recycling, reducing the costly process of separation.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to decrease patient referral wait times. Referral wait times are often long since offices need to retrieve a large amount of medical information on a patient before they are seen by a doctor. Unfortunately, medical records are often not stored in one place, making it difficult to gather the needed medical histories. Quick and complete medical record retrieval is especially important for cancer patients, whose conditions can quickly change. Critical patients need to be seen by doctors in a timely manner to begin treatment. The company is creating a technology that could help quickly retrieve medical information to decrease the time from referral to appointment. The company expects these algorithms to expedite document reconciliation by 7 days, thereby reducing the time from referral for the new patient appointment by 1 week.By facilitating quicker and more meaningful record retrieval, the algorithms are expected to improve treatment initiation by 7-14 days.

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the negative environmental impacts of rare earth element (REE) production through the development of a clean, sustainable system for REE extraction and purification using biology. Such a system would allow for affordable, low-impact REE production in the United States which, in turn, would reduce dependence on REE imports, alleviating a significant supply risk and concerns for national security. REEs are critical for manufacturing many modern electronics and sustainable energy technologies, including electric motors and wind turbine generators, solid state lighting, battery anodes, high-temperature superconductors, and high-strength lightweight alloys. Such applications are increasing demands on the global REE supply, which is predominantly controlled outside of the United States due to the cost of environmental regulations and labor. Nearly all REE production today comes from mining ore, which can cause its own environmental detriment, and will not be able to meet the rising demand for REEs. To bridge the gap between supply and demand, and attenuate the impacts of mining, REEs will be recovered from various waste and end-of-life sources, promoting a circular economy. The recovery of REEs from secondary sources would create new jobs, especially with the development of new infrastructure for the collection and pre-processing of REE-containing materials._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe output of this SBIR Phase I project is an end-to-end biological system for REE recovery that can replace the most environmentally damaging steps from source to market, including bio-extraction, selection, and separation of REEs. The use of microorganisms for each step allows for a much cleaner process, and genomic optimization for rapid customization to a variety of REE feedstocks. REE bio-extraction is done with biodegradable lixiviant produced by optimized microbial strains. Bio-selection is done with REE-specific ligands immobilized in a synthetic biological matrix. Finally, bio-separations are done through the selective sorption and desorption of different REEs to engineered bacterial membranes in columns that bind specific REEs with different affinities. Genetic customization is enabled through comprehensive identification of the genetic elements underlying a trait of interest, followed by incorporation of genetic engineering for optimization of the overall commercial process. In Phase I of the project, efforts are focused on the identification of the variables that most contribute to efficiency, as well as the genetic mechanisms driving those variables._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to test an innovative new approach to generating industrially valuable microorganisms. If successful, the new approach will be demonstrated by improving the ability of an engineered bacterium to convert components of biomass into fuel. The benefit of that research will be to help develop a technology that can convert domestically-produced, non-food biomass into fuel at a low enough cost that it can become a significant part of America’s energy solution. The United States would realize multiple benefits from the production of such low-cost cellulosic biofuels. However, realization of this objective requires innovative new approaches that meaningfully decrease the cost of conversion. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project seeks an innovative new approach to engineering bacterial phenotypes with an unknown genetic basis, while at the same time producing strains useful for a method of biomass conversion called Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP). The technology will expand the complexity of phenotypes that can be developed in industrial microbes by non-directed /evolutionary methods by taking advantage of natural competence, which is the ability of some bacteria to take up DNA. The solution demonstrates the feasibility of a technique called Continuous Evolution with Multiplex Natural Transformation (CE-MuNT), in a program of selection for commercially valuable phenotypes that have a complex, uncharacterized genetic basis. By using massive and rapid genetic transfers that do not require human intervention, it may be possible to rapidly create a large set of genetically diverse mutants that can then be selected for the targeted characteristics. Importantly, the approach is not limited by the significant knowledge gaps that exist about the organism. The project will initiate studies aimed at catalytically converting biomass-derived ethanol to hydrocarbons that are suited to aviation and heavy-duty applications._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These satellites will have two key advantages over the existing satellites. First, they will fly significantly lower than current satellites providing superior Earth Observation and satellite broadband communication quality. Second, they will enable refuellable space tugs that can perform a servicing mission and then descend into the atmosphere to refuel. Furthermore, by flying in these low orbits, satellites will naturally de-orbit at the end of life and leave orbits uncluttered. Finally, the proposed space tugs will reduce the need for powerful chemical rockets (for both launch and in-space maneuvers). _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate satellite air-breathing electric propulsion.

Optical components, with well-known examples being mirrors, polarizers, and lenses, are essential building blocks in a host of civilian and military systems including imaging, telecommunications, and laser systems. Current optical component technology is a multi-billion-dollar industry and is based on multiple layers of films deposited in vacuum chambers. The proposed innovation realizes a new optical component class with the functionality of multi-film assemblies generated in a single layer with attendant savings in time and cost. The project focuses on the long-wave infrared spectral domain where traditional thin-film technology is impractical due to the extreme film thicknesses needed. The long-wave domain covers a region of atmospheric transparency essential for terrestrial imaging, medical and industrial laser technologies, and night-vision systems. _x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis innovation focuses on optical component fabrication that is based on gratings that are index-matched to a sublayer thereby avoiding localized, particle-type resonances. This attribute imbues the components with tolerance to parametric deviations essential for practical manufacturing.

Therefore, a new dimension in functionality with high levels of spectral diversity and control is brought into the optical component arena supporting many societally valuable applications. In Phase I, relevant fabrication processes will be developed to show the potential for scale-up to mass production.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is connected to creating a large-scale source of low production cost, carbon-free hydrogen. This hydrogen will be produced from hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Nearly 8 million tons of H2S are processed by the energy industry each year. Sulfur recovery units (SRUs) are used to safely manage H2S. SRUs utilize an old Claus process and are unprofitable because of high capital and operational costs, in addition to low revenues due to sulfur overproduction. In contrast to the Claus process, H2S plasma dissociation recovers sulfur and hydrogen, whereby the sulfur can be used for oil desulfurization or as a commercial product.Dissociating H2S in plasma and producing hydrogen will make SRUs profitable and will reduce the industry's carbon dioxide emissions. This technology will diminish societal needs for fossil fuel production and increase energy security during the transition to renewable energy. The team will develop a numerical model for the high-speed, two-phase, vortex flows that will have a general academic interest and can be applied in the chemical and energy industries._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a plasma technology for the dissociation of H2S to sulfur and hydrogen, replacing Claus plants in Sulfur Recovery Units. Phase I will focus on three innovations that are critical for the H2S dissociation development program. The major goal is the high energy efficiency expressed as Specific Energy Requirement 1.5 kWh/m3. This goal will be achieved by a special design of the arc plasmatron with an extremely high speed of gas rotation that will result in hydrogen-sulfur separation in the reaction zone, the chemical equilibrium shift, and the internal recuperation of the sulfur clusterization and condensation energy. The second innovation will be the development of a gas-dynamic and chemical-kinetic model for the numerical simulation of two-phase (gas and sulfur particles) vortex flows with a high speed of rotation. Third, the stability of the cathode and plasmatron operation will be tested with different gas mixtures that imitate the composition of real flows at refineries._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a technology to explore the utility in the ubiquity of iron on both Earth and Mars. The ores of many metals are iron-rich, mixed materials, including those of 33+ metals critical for a sustainable future. However, high iron content is a nuisance for most established metal extractions. For example, iron, rare earth elements, and unextracted aluminum remain in the vast tailing ponds generated by aluminum feed processing. This project develops a better method for processing many mixed-material industrial wastes and ores. The method is called fast iron carbonylation and is expected to lower the cost of iron and nickel powders, add value by making better concentrates of rare earth elements and many other energy metals, and clean up metal processing and waste sites. This process will inexpensively and profitably produce metal feeds for battery manufacturing and enable the benefits of clean electric transport. The fast iron carbonylation-based steel-making hardware is rugged, simple-to-operate, and light weight. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project develops and tests a reactor to carry out fast iron carbonylation. Iron and nickel carbonylation are reversible, exothermic gas/solid reactions. Carbonylation in state-of-the-art, industrial-scale reactors is significantly impeded such that, at large scales, achieving high per-unit volume reaction rates is challenging. The proposed fast iron carbonylation reactor seeks to drive the reversible reactions far from equilibrium to achieve net carbonyl production at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art carbonylation. The project will run tests on relevant mixed-material metal ores and industrial wastes at scales much larger than are typical for benchtop experiments (~5 kg samples). These tests aim to extract close to 100% of the iron and nickel in the test samples and produce residues that can be readily processed to produce high value concentrates of rare earth elements and other critical metals._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Efforts to expand the genetic code have shown that the natural translation system is capable of selectively incorporating a wide range of synthetic amino acids (sAAs). However, several roadblocks have substantially limited the field to only one or a few instances of site-specific incorporation of sAAs. These include: biological restrictions to altering ribosome sequence, poor efficiencies of orthogonal translation systems for sAA incorporation, and unavailable open codons that have constrained biopolymer synthesis to tag-and-modify approaches or simple protein decorations. This project seeks to address these challenges in bringing this innovation to market by combining a genomically recoded organism containing engineered translation machinery with Ribo-T to enable the production of synthetic biopolymers with synthetic monomers. Additionally, this project aims to establish the technical capabilities of encoding two distinct sAAs into a single polymer. Together, these Phase I goals will advance a biomaterials platform to produce synthetic biopolymers with multiple synthetic chemistries to de-risk a path toward novel polymer biologics._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As a result, 7% of cancer patients suffer from debilitating fear of cancer recurrence. Early and accurate diagnosing of residual cancer cells will improve the outcome for the 20% of cancer patients who experience recurrence.Additionally, it will help the 7% of cancer patients who suffer from debilitating fear of cancer recurrence.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from cancer cells circulates through the blood stream. This cancer can be detected because of mutations in the DNA of cancer cells. However, cancer DNA is rare compared to normal DNA, which makes diagnosing cancer from a blood draw difficult. Proof-of-concept data has shown that accuracy can be greatly improved through the enrichment of cancer DNA from a sample. After the sample is collected, the DNA goes through rounds of duplication, except a blocker is added to prevent normal DNA from duplicating. Through this process the cancer DNA becomes a larger percentage of the overall DNA in the sample and can be more accurately detected. This project will develop a collection of tests for accurately diagnosing residual colorectal cancer. The key tasks of this project are: 1) demonstrate the clinical robustness of the optimized test method, 2) develop additional tests to cover most colorectal cancers, and 3) demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods.

NK cells are able to recognize almost any cancerous cell in the body and can target both solid tumors and blood cancers. This gives NK cells a broad appeal for the treatment of many types of cancer. The team proposes a broad-spectrum cancer treatment by modifying NK cells to be more reactive to cancerous cells in the body. These modified NK cells could potentially be combined with current therapies to enhance their effectiveness, without increasing side-effects in patients. This project has the potential to benefit millions of people, especially in the United States where it is estimated that 40% of individuals will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life. _x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis project will use a patented epigenetic modifier to enhance the tumor killing abilities of NK cells. Many immune cell-based therapies rely on altering the genetic code of the cell that will be used to treat disease. However, there are associated risks in altering the genetic code and often the cell therapy may only work on a very specific subtype of cancer. Epigenetic modifiers do not change the underlying DNA sequence but can effectively alter gene expression. Furthermore, NK cells can target a broad-spectrum of cancers but in many cancer patients their tumor killing ability is often suppressed. The research goal is to use the patented epigenetic modifier to increase expression of key NK cells genes that will make them more sensitive to detecting and killing cancer cells. After targeting key genes, NK cells will be assessed for increased tumor killing ability and for how long this ability persists. More specifically, this project seeks to demonstrate that NK cells taken from a healthy donor can be epigenetically altered to enhance their natural function of killing tumor cells. This solution will lay the groundwork to develop a NK cell therapy where NK cells isolated from healthy donors are epigenetically modified to enhance their activity, then delivered to cancer patients to hunt and kill their cancer cells._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the thermal and mechanical limits of novel, fiber-reinforced, plastic composite materials (FRPs) and pioneer a fast-manufacturing process for these FRPs. FRPs have the potential to achieve significant lightweighting and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions reductions by displacing steel and aluminum in many industries including aerospace, automotive, construction, infrastructure, marine, and wind energy. However, difficulties in their processing and slow production have made FRPs too expensive for widespread adoption. If successful, the proposed project will enable FRP adoption in more price-sensitive industries such as automotive and infrastructure for widespread greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A shorter-term market that can be addressed with this technology is the FRP mold market. FRP molds are used to make FRPs but are also themselves made of FRPs. Cheaper FRP molds with shorter lead times are a major need for manufacturers. The domestic market for mold making was estimated to be $21.6 billion in 2020. As the FRP market continues to grow, the mold making market is expected to grow in kind. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes new, fiber-reinforced, plastic composite materials (FRPs), associated manufacturing processes, and methods of optimization thereof. The core innovation is resin chemistry with a unique form of low energy, rapid curing. This project will be the first critical step in developing new manufacturing processes that exploit this curing phenomenon for faster, cheaper FRP fabrication. This Phase I research is split into three stages. In stage 1, the effect of different resin components on the final thermal and mechanical properties of the FRP parts will be evaluated. In stage 2, a prototype system will be developed for fast fabrication of large test specimens. Common failure modes will be understood, and optimal processing conditions will be determined. In stage 3, different form factors of fiber fillers will be used. This project will establish the fundamentals and common failure modes of a novel, more efficient FRP manufacturing process._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in accelerating the transition to a more sustainable food supply chain, which could democratize access to healthy foods and lessen food insecurity.The US system for growing and distributing fresh food is inefficient and insufficient in the context of climate change. Controlled environmental agriculture (CEA) is seen as a potentially revolutionary way to supply food demands with limited resources.Despite this promise, the high energy requirements of creating lighting and cooling in enclosed environments to support photosynthesis has caused CEA not to realize its promise.In the project, a novel solution to improve energy efficiency in CEA farms is proposed where advanced optics, machine learning, and computer vision are used to ensure that all of the light that is emitted by synthetic light sources is optimally used for plant photosynthesis and growth.The project offers a plausible way to create reliably profitable operations for CEA producers which would lead to enhanced access to fresh produce for consumers and decreased reliance on conventional agriculture to meet the world’s food needs._x000D_\n_x000D_\nWithin current commercial grow systems for controlled environment agriculture, a substantial portion of the photons are wasted as they are not incident onto photosynthetically active biomass and are absorbed by the surrounding grow rack and media. This project will prototype and systematically test a light production system that dynamically shapes light such that it is rendered only onto the photosynthetic areas of the plant.To accomplish this, the project will develop and evaluate (within three crop varieties) a closed-loop system to autonomously detect the three-dimensional shape of the growing plant and dynamically adjust the light intensity and projection area to optimize power efficiency and biomass growth. Successful completion of the work in this project will result in a novel technology that is systematically tested to yield similar quality produce using a fraction of the energy consumption of current state-of-the-art systems.Deployment of this technology would help to improve the unit economics of controlled environment agriculture produce items and accelerate adoption of controlled environment agriculture farming practices that potentially consume less water, utilize land resources more efficiently, and eliminate the need for chemical pesticide/herbicide treatments._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is technology to improve the efficiency of building energy consumption. Windows account for about 30% of building energy losses and 7% of US carbon emissions. Vacuum insulated glass (VIG) windows are 4-5 times more insulating than a typical double-pane glass windows and are almost as insulating as the surrounding walls. A low-temperature production method will make vacuum insulated glass much more affordable. Such highly efficient and low-cost vacuum insulated glass will enable replacement of widely used double pane windows thus reducing the building carbon footprint. This decrease in pollution is especially significant given the push for net zero energy buildings and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Major sectors that will benefit from such window developments are residential buildings, commercial buildings, and supermarkets (freezer/cooler doors). Market research indicates the VIG market is more than $25 billion._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis SBIR Phase I project will develop low temperature, vacuum insulated, glass windows that dramatically reduce the production cost of the currently available vacuum insulated glass (VIG). Although vacuum insulated glass products are highly efficient and have been produced for more than 30 years, they have not found market acceptance due to very high cost and poor seal reliability. Current high temperature, VIG manufacturing processes are slow and require expensive vacuum furnaces resulting in high costs. The proposed flexible seal VIG manufacturing process is a low-temperature production method that is much faster, thus requiring much lower capital investment, bringing VIG costs much closer to that of double pane windows. The novel flexible seal design of the proposed VIG also improves long-term seal reliability by eliminating thermal expansion stresses experienced by current rigid VIG seals. The performance and long-term durability of small VIG samples made using the low-temperature seal were validated. However, scale-up must be demonstrated before successful VIG development. The current project aims to scale up the proposed VIG manufacturing process and subject full-scale samples to rigorous accelerated weather, temperature, impact testing. A secondary seal will also be developed to prevent it from weather and gas permeation to ensure 50+ years of window life._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes improving the reproducibility of automated life science workflows while simultaneously reducing their carbon footprint. Automated life science workflows are increasingly prevalent in medical (e.g., laboratory tests and diagnostics) and research (e.g., next generation sequencing) applications, and mixing is a ubiquitous and often repeatedly performed operation in these assays. The novel mixing technology to be developed will confer myriad benefits. By reducing assay turnaround times and improving assay reliability, it will decrease wait times for medical screening, diagnosis and monitoring, enabling faster diagnoses and treatments. By decreasing the materials costs of the assays, this technology may reduce the costs of medical testing and improve access to care. It also can enhance partnerships between academic and industry laboratories by giving academic laboratories access to industry workflows that are currently prohibitively expensive. Finally, by eliminating a substantial portion of the single-use plastic consumed by assays, this novel mixing technology will help curb the waste generated by life science assays, which will help alleviate the single-use plastic waste crisis. _x000D__x000D_\nThe proposed project will deliver an innovative mixing technology that is based on a photo-acoustic streaming phenomenon. Briefly, when glass implanted with metal nanoparticles (metal-implanted materials (MIMs)) is excited by a pulsed laser, it causes an adjacent fluid (liquid or gas) to begin streaming for the duration of the illumination. This streaming creates an opportunity to precisely control mixing, but key technical challenges include optimizing the MIMs’ form factor and devising an effective, yet also inexpensive, illumination system. The proposed project’s objectives address these challenges by: (i) evaluating the effectiveness of mixing solutions with a novel MIM form factor that can be incorporated easily into existing automated life science workflows, (ii) determining if functional MIMs can be fabricated in bulk by procuring them from a supplier and characterizing them for nanoparticle implantation and laser-induced solution streaming, and (iii) testing an alternative laser light source that powers mixing and consists of a low-cost light emitting diode (LED) laser._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This failure is because every tumor is distinct in makeup and response to treatment. Unfortunately, a generalized treatment approach is forced upon a disease that is uniquely personal due to lack of personalized predictive tools. Consequently, patients are exposed to several rounds of potentially harmful overtreatment until the right regimen is found. Adding insult to injury, over 40% of patients deplete their entire life savings in just 2 years. In discussions with leadership from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and private insurance providers – who currently spend over $35 billion annually on treating just five types of cancer – the inability to match treatments to tumors was unanimously the critical, unmet, and urgent market need. This proposal can make a profound impact on the lives of cancer patients, offer substantial cost savings to insurance providers, and strengthen US leadership in advanced research._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project represents a major departure from the traditional, one-size-fits-all approach to cancer treatment. The proposed technology will rapidly match biopsy tissue from a patient’s tumor with various treatment regimens – before treatment, outside the patient – to identify the right treatment for that patient. In order to achieve clinical translation for this technology, during this SBIR Phase I project, the company will address several key objectives: 1) establish standard guidelines for tissue collection, handling, and cold chain logistics to minimize the impact of these factors on the viability of live solid-tumor biospecimens; 2) generate 3D bio-printed mimics of patient biopsies for extensive validation and refinement of the technology; and 3) demonstrate the predictive capacity of this platform for personalized cancer treatment. If successful, this personalized approach will not only reduce the cost of cancer treatment incurred by health insurance providers but, more importantly, also lighten the emotional, physical, and financial burden suffered by patients._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable smaller, lighter, and higher-performance satellites, thereby making satellites cheaper to manufacture and launch. Lighter satellites reduce launch costs or permit greater payload performance for a given mass. Less fuel is required to launch lighter satellites, reducing the environmental impact of greenhouse gases generated during launch. Internet connectivity through satellite is becoming increasingly pervasive, and if costs continue to decline, it might become ubiquitous, supporting workforce development and educational outreach in hitherto unserved places. Many components, such as power supplies, can be made lighter and smaller when silicon carbide semiconductors are utilized in place of silicon high voltage devices in applications such as aerospace and satellites. The ultimate goal is to replace all silicon high-voltage devices in satellites and aerospace with silicon carbide products. It has been demonstrated that conventionally designed commercial high voltage silicon carbide materials cannot withstand the high radiation levels encountered in outer space applications. The objective of this project is to develop, manufacture, test, and demonstrate the viability of silicon carbide high voltage semiconductor products that are resistant to radiation levels comparable to those encountered in space._x000D_\n_x000D_\nCommercially available silicon carbide (SiC) power devices are not approved for use in heavy ion radiation environments due to their susceptibility to catastrophic failure and burnout at voltages below 20% of the specified voltage when exposed to radiation. Consequently, SiC high voltage devices are not currently used in space applications, despite the fact that they offer very compelling features for mission-critical applications. Using simulation tools, the team has created a SiC junction barrier Schottky diode that can operate at up to 1200 V under high ion radiation. A radiation-resistant silicon carbide junction barrier Schottky diode rated at 1200 V will be designed, produced, and tested for radiation resistance. To accomplish the target radiation performance, a multi-pronged strategy will be applied, including novel device designs to reduce the electric field and mitigation of thermal runaway caused by ion strike when the device is under reverse bias.Schottky barrier materials with improved thermal stability will be used. Successful implementation of the intended approach will open the way for the integration of SiC Schottky diode devices in space applications._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "This broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will improve public safety by furthering terahertz radar imaging technology for concealed threat detection. With increasing cases of weapons violence and mass casualty events across the nation, and an increase in the difficulty of detecting non-metallic weapons such as 3D-printed firearms and ceramic knives, a significant gap exists in threat detection technologies. This solution addresses a recognized need in an approximately $2 billion market which includes law enforcement and event venue security. Existing approaches (such as airport scanners and walkthrough metal detectors) are expensive, intrusive, and inconvenient or leave large gaps in detection capability.Terahertz radar imaging promises the performance of gold-standard airport scanners in a consumer grade, portable, and discreet device. By demonstrating a terahertz radar transceiver, this Phase I effort will de-risk a key technical element of this technology, which is critical for security applications and beyond. If successful, this project represents a significant step forward in addressing society’s concealed threat detection issues._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project revolves around the design, implementation, fabrication and testing of a terahertz radar transceiver, a key component in the approach used in a personnel screening device. No such transceiver is currently available to purchase on the open market, let alone at the costs and volumes required for the proposed commercial applications. When paired with other elements of the imaging system, the result will be a three-dimensional radar imager which is capable of “seeing through” dielectric materials such as fabrics and detecting concealed weapons and contraband, both metallic and non-metallic. The transceiver design effort will feature development of components such as frequency multipliers, amplifiers and mixers, and their electrical, mechanical, and thermal integration into a larger imaging system.This design phase will prioritize achieving cost, yield, and scalability metrics compatible with mass manufacture and widespread deployment. Key considerations involved in this effort are the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Dynamic Range (DR) of the system, both important metrics in imaging performance and therefore weapons detection capability.

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is protection against pathogen-related infections. Currently, detection tests for pathological agents are laborious, time-consuming, expensive, and require advanced technical expertise to conduct. The proposed portable, onsite pathogen detector will allow for fast, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective pathogen tests that can be conducted with minimal personnel training and equipment. The solution is intended to be used at healthcare centers, transport nodes, defense facilities, and any other site where the spread of infectious diseases is a possibility. This technology will benefit the population’s health and welfare, by facilitating the implementation of pathogen detection routines that reduce the risk of large-scale infections.Such infections disproportionally affect under-represented groups.The solution will also improve the national defense against bioterrorism, since the proposed technology could be as standard as a typical metal detector used in large, populated venues, on the battlefield protecting troops, or at airports to keep the traveling public safe.The nation’s economic competitiveness may also improve, since the proposed solution could mitigate and even avoid the economic consequences of a health crisis._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe proposed project seeks to prove that Matrix Assisted Ionization can be coupled with Ion-Mobility Spectrometry (MAI-IMS) for pathogen detection and identification. The recent pandemic outbreak has demonstrated the necessity of rapid, on-site, and accurate pathogen detection devices. The proposed method is to use the existing IMS technology and modify it to detect pathogens by fabricating a Matrix assisted ionization vault (Helios-1) that overcomes the biomolecule volatility restriction of all current ion mobility spectrometers. A crucial technical hurdle is finding the device's optimal ionization and operational environment. To overcome this challenge, the most similar conditions to mass spectrometry must be found, which will involve experimental tests to determine the adequate environmental conditions and the engineering modifications of the MAI extension chamber to adapt IMS for non-volatile biomolecule detection. Standardize organism sample conditions and protocols are also needed. This challenge represents a critical step to prevent variation caused by the extraction of the sampling procedure. This challenge will be tackled by testing different extraction procedures until they meet the criteria for satisfactory performance. Additionally, machine learning algorithms will be employed for pathogen recognition. All of the above will help prove the feasibility of the proposed MAI-IMS-based pathogen detection and identification platform._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project include the development of a gene therapy platform that will allow the use of genetic therapeutics in areas beyond rare diseases, tackling large unmet clinical needs such as diabetes, osteoarthritis, and autoimmune diseases. The project will also enable significant reductions in the costs of gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics. Finally, the development of the proposed platform technology will enable the production of medical treatments that are injected less frequently, produce a potentially more optimal treatment profile, and prevent complications related to missed doses or therapeutic overdose. The societal and commercial impacts of this technology are significant, as the proposed technology could greatly expand the potential of gene therapy, while replacing other biologic-based therapies with a lower cost alternative. The technology has significant commercial value but is, at the same time, able to greatly reduce societal medical costs associated with current treatment approaches._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project develops a dose-adjustable gene therapy mechanism that can be used to up- or down-regulate a gene therapy dose, following initial administration. Despite recent advances and regulatory approvals, gene therapy remains limited due to its inherent shortcomings in dose adjustment – once a gene therapy dose is administered, it cannot be increased or decreased by secondary intervention. On the other hand, many therapeutics require adjustment of the initially prescribed dose over a period of weeks or months to optimize the efficacy and side-effects profile. This project aims to develop and characterize the first, fully adjustable gene therapy, capable of predictable post-treatment dose adjustment. To accomplish this, a number of technological hurdles will be addressed as part of the project including non-viral delivery of genetic material to human cells, the ability to control the gene expression in a predictable and measurable manner, and the assurance that any adjustability is safe to the patient organs, tissues, and cells that neighbor the treatment area._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved access to 3D x-ray imaging in everyday life. Currently 3D x-ray imaging is used for applications where it is absolutely necessary to non-destructively image an object. One example is in healthcare, known as computed tomography, where imaging is performed 250,000 times per day in the US saving countless lives by enabling doctors to quickly identify and treat disease such as stroke, heart attack, and cancer. Airports are other locations where computed tomography is heavily used to quickly inspect millions of bags per day to catch threats that were once unable to be seen through conventional x-ray systems. The systems capable of 3D x-ray imaging for the applications mentioned above are large, expensive and immobile which prevent their use in more applications. This project enables a new architecture for 3D x-ray imaging which promises to make systems less expensive, smaller and more compact, require less power and demonstrate higher performance. This new architecture will enable access to 3D x-ray imaging for new applications by making it more affordable and available where and when it is needed, outside of key infrastructure locations like hospitals and airports._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the first step in developing the most critical component to a new 3D x-ray imaging architecture: a miniature, high-performance, and inexpensive x-ray source. Modern 3D x-ray imaging systems are large, expensive and immobile due to the method of generating 3D images. A single x-ray source and detector arc pair are rotated at high speeds to generate 2D images at different angles which are used to reconstruct a 3D model. Modern x-ray sources and detectors are very bulky, weighing over 100 pounds each, and necessitate substantial structural reinforcement, resulting in systems that weigh over 1000 pounds. The proposed new architecture uses a stationary ring of x-ray sources and detectors. The x-ray sources are electrically turned on and off mimicking the rotation of modern 3D x-ray imaging systems without spinning, resulting in a system that is inexpensive and smaller, and uses lower power while demonstrating higher performance. For these aspirations to be realized, a miniature x-ray source that is smaller, high-performance and inexpensive must be developed. This project will take the first steps to characterize such an x-ray source by measuring key metrics such as the performance, resolution and reliability.The design will be iterated through simulations._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment.Cancer affects millions of Americans and people worldwide. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reports that the number of new cancer cases will reach 30 million by 2040, representing an enormous cost to American society and the economy. There is a dire need for innovative technologies such as molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine to combat cancer. Modern molecular testing methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) often suffer from low tumor content and genetic contamination from non-cancer cells contained in their samples - resulting in an insufficient amount of DNA for accurate molecular testing.This research will focus on microdissection as a means of obtaining cancer cells for testing. The proposed tumor cell purification and extraction will enable the company to focus on modelling and optimalization of individualized cancer treatments rather than non-cancer cells.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a grid-scale battery to enable large-scale, long-duration energy storage. New technologies for long-duration energy storage are required to solve the challenge of renewable energy intermittency. The widespread deployment of a new battery technology based on ubiquitous and inexpensive chemistry that is fabricated from low-cost and high-throughput manufacturable cell materials will help society achieve climate goals and bolster American manufacturing and energy independence. Additionally, the energy landscape of the future clearly presents enormous commercial potential. US grid storage capacity today is less than 0.01% of daily generation. Globally, the estimated energy storage needs to meet climate goals is 15 Terawatt hours by 2030. This translates to a market opportunity of $1.3 trillion to be fulfilled by emerging technologies. _x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to design and fabricate a prototype battery system using highly stable, proprietary electrolytes and knowledge gathered from an SBIR Phase I award that verified the stability of charge storage solutions when in contact with inexpensive cell fabrication materials (plastics, rubbers, and composites). This project will validate performance in full-scale cells, stacks and systems, and culminate in the delivery of a battery system capable of outputting 1 kW for 10 hours. The delivered 1 kW/10 kWh system will have a longer lifetime (20+ years) and demonstrated lower cost than current flow batteries available today and will represent a significant step towards the development of a utility scale energy storage system._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to control several critical pathogens and pests on multiple crops, in order to help feed the growing world population more sustainably. The global crop pest and disease control landscape is facing big challenges: many diseases are not well controlled and important chemical pesticides are restricted or banned due to their toxicity. There is a critical need for new types of disease control products that will be effective and will not harm the environment or human health. This proposal will lead to the development of a platform that can quickly generate new products to target poorly controlled pathogens, mitigating the development of resistant pathogens. This solution will increase farmers’ productivity and reduce their financial losses, while ensuring a more secure food supply._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThe proposed project will identify ecologically-safe peptides that will protect crops from diseases. The peptides will be designed to bind to, and interfere with, the function of proteins that the disease organisms produce, and which are essential to the disease process. The peptides will be designed to bind only to those proteins, so they will not have off-target effects. The ability to rapidly design and test such peptides will make it possible to target multiple proteins from a pathogen, reducing the risk that the pathogen will develop resistance. It will also be possible to target a wide range of diseases with similar life cycles, providing farmers with broad protection. The project will choose the optimum target proteins, design the peptides, and optimize the peptides to maximize binding to the targets. The peptides will be tested for their ability to prevent infection in the lab, and then will be produced at a larger scale and tested under the field conditions. The peptides will also be tested for safety as required for regulatory approval._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The beachhead market is Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO), an acute blinding orphan disease for which no effective treatment exists. CRAO is an ophthalmologic emergency wherein the main artery that carries blood to the inner retina is occluded, in a stroke-like fashion by a plaque, resulting in sudden loss of vision. In humans, the window of opportunity for intervention exists between 24-36 hours after the occlusion before spontaneous reperfusion, which occurs in ~72 hours in about 90% of the cases. The company will develop, test, and validate a safe and stable oxygen nanodelivery formulation that can be delivered through pars plana, a standard method for administration of therapeutics into the vitreous cavity.

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in exposing students to cultures other than their own to foster empathy, not only for others, but to better understand themselves and their own culture. The 21st century workforce requires multilingual, curious, collaborative, empathetic learners. Yet, immersive opportunities to exercise empathy cross-culturally are difficult to access and empathy requires practice. Geographic and cultural knowledge from travel abroad programs is proven to increase empathy, but such experiences serve relatively few students. Schools need a cost-effective and safe way of equitably delivering immersive cross-cultural engagement to meet increasingly global demands. This project intends to present the international film festival as a rich learning atmosphere, replicable at scale to serve learners well beyond the traditional audience diversity and number. The immersive experience will be delivered to respond to learning needs in the classrooms, after-school programs, hospitals, and refugee centers.The films will be expertly curated, globally streamed, co-viewed across time zones, and enhanced with moderated curriculum. _x000D_\n_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project replicates and magnifies aspects of the film festival model which correspond to social impact business innovation, specifically, empathy.

This series of assessments engages the learner to better understand how they learn, while reinforcing the memory of learning of a culture outside of their own as integral to their developing worldview.The project also establishes a foundation for both media and cultural literacy. The platform will activate non-generative artificial intelligence (AI) in service of matching profiles, scheduling, automation, assessment tabulation and reporting, and archiving. The technology will employ generative AI with AR (augmented reality) in service of translation in post-film discussion as well as location-based information to enable additional points of empathy for discussion.With respect to assessments, AI will be used to provide feedback to participants, impacting learning episode memory.The assessments will also serve in the facilitation of qualitative assessments so that participants receive timely reports, illuminating similarities and differences._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to help educators to develop deeper relationships with their students, assist schools in identifying students who lack strong relationships and need additional support, and help school districts understand the emotional health and relationship strength of their schools. Student emotional well-being, student absenteeism, and teacher burnout are some of the most pressing problems facing K-12 education today. A significant body of research shows that positive student-teacher relationships help students adjust to school, contribute to social skill development, promote academic performance and resiliency, decrease absenteeism, and foster engagement. Schools struggle with relationship building at scale - it takes time to form connections, not all students are willing to open up, and teachers need help and training on understanding and responding to the varied experiences and needs of their students. This project, if successful, will help schools address these challenges at scale. Additionally, the data from this project will help teachers contribute to learning science and behavioral health research, while providing a blueprint to the education technology industry on how to implement advanced technology in an ethical and transparent manner that augments, rather than replaces, existing education structures and systems._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project builds an innovative technology that will understand and measure the strength of the student-teacher relationships at scale. The technology will develop new frameworks for defining trusting relationships based on the depth of student reflections, teacher responses, and how responses change and grow week over week. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques will model these frameworks based on real student-teacher interactions.NLP typically focuses on using models to understand text inputs and predict/generate responses. Through this project, the team seeks to use new NLP/ML techniques to understand and assess the interactions and levels of trust between individuals. The NLP/ML models will analyze the depth of student reflections and interpret the nature of the teacher responses separately. The output of these two models will then be combined to understand the strength of student-teacher relationship by creating a student-teacher relationship trust metric. This metric will help understand student-teacher relationships at scale across schools and districts all over the country._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "Tragically, 936 children have died in hot cars since 1998. Wisely, NHTSA has prioritized evaluation of sensor systems in vehicles for “the ability to detect unattended children and prevent heat stroke occurrence.”Recently, innovators have developed systems that detect children present in the vehicle by measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) in the vehicle cabin, but there is no test method to assess whether or not these CO2 sensor systems are working properly.Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop the CO2ATD - a manikin the exhales CO2 in a manner similar to a 12 month old, or 3 or 6 year old child.The CO2ATD itself, which is a humanoid structure of dimension and mass distribution of a human 12 month old, has an upper airway including nostrils and mouth similar to that of a human. The CO2ATD inhales air from the cabin and exhales CO2-enriched air to the cabin, at a breathing rate, tidal volume and CO2 concentration similar to the 12 month old or 3 or 6 year old child, as specified by the test technician. Breathing is accomplished in a “Lung” that is connected to the CO2ATD via a “Trachea” which terminates at the nostrils/mouth.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms that generate content for word-meaning video games at an affordable cost. Word-meaning games support literacy, fluency, critical thinking, and cross-cultural understanding for players of all ages and backgrounds via adaptive vocabulary scaling systems and accessibility options for players with visual or motor difficulties. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) literacy is supported by incorporating STEM content in a mix of entertaining and serious content. These prosocial and cognitive impacts are essential for personal and professional growth, cultural competence, and will be measured by game learning researchers. The project will also contribute to the field of natural language processing and machine learning through the addition of new benchmarks to open-source resources. Success in reducing content creation costs could lead to licensing content to other game publishers and the creation of additional word-meaning games on the market, benefiting players. This project is uniquely positioned to help retain game industry jobs in the U.S. and contribute to the growth of the industry._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe technical innovation of the project is threefold: 1) development of algorithms for unrelated word content generation, 2) development of appropriateness and offensiveness filters for natural language content, and 3) evaluation of a word-meaning game’s ability to improve cognitive function and social awareness. This research and development has the potential to address a gap in the field of natural language processing on unrelatedness.Part of this effort contributes to open-source benchmarks for future research. Similarly, social bias is a prevalent and well-known issue in machine learning models, potentially offensive or inappropriate word combinations need to be detected and avoided via newly developed algorithms that explicitly detect and avoid publishing such content. To achieve both goals, a variety of machine learning techniques, including those that leverage existing large natural language models, will be employed and evaluated for accuracy. Using these algorithms as a foundation for content creation, the word-meaning game will integrate the generated content.The program will be evaluated with regard to its ability to increase social awareness and confidence with an expanding vocabulary. Specifically, the study will evaluate both brief gameplay and long-term gameplay and measure efficacy with in-game metrics and surveys._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel hearing protection device which reduces the societal cost of noise induced hearing loss. Noise induced hearing loss is the one of the most prevalent occupational injuries in both US industry and the military, affecting more than 10 million workers at a total preventable economic cost exceeding $100 billion. Most employers rely primarily on personal hearing protection devices to limit exposure on a sustained basis. However, issues limit their real-world performance and leave a majority of wearers with sub optimal protection. Up to 80% of workers wear hearing protection in an inconsistent manner which significantly reduces their effectiveness.

Theoretical modelling of sound attenuation will be translated into prototypes that demonstrate performance measures in laboratory test fixtures, followed by a patient validation study. The project aims to demonstrate that the company’s new ear plug provides superior sound protection of up to 40 dB suppression while enabling improved communication.Incorporation of attributes preferred by users enables greater adoption compared to existing designs._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of materials and processes for semiconductor manufacturing that will enable the progression of Moore’s Law and help to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity and capability. Recent supply chain issues have plagued the semiconductor industry, and this has had ripple effects throughout the American economy. The majority of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity is outside of the U.S. and this recent shortage has highlighted the need for domestic foundries both for economic vitality in the U.S. as well as national security and supply chain resiliency. In 2019, American semiconductor foundries directly employed 184,600 workers, down from 292,100 (-37%) in 2001. The main loss of manufacturing jobs was attributed to the utilization of offshore foundries.Currently, U.S. semiconductor manufacturing represents just 1% of global capacity and 80% of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity is in the 200 mm (8-inch) format, which is not compatible with the most advanced, high-performance processes, limiting production to greater than65 nm nodes. This project will increase the competitiveness of currently established U.S.-based foundries as well as increase the performance of foundries that are under construction. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project seeks to develop and validate the performance of several required materials to enable the integration of a novel semiconductor manufacturing process that has the capability to double the density of features in current cutting-edge semiconductor chip manufacturing processes.This solution may also simplify the overall manufacturing process, without the need for intensive capital expenditures. At the conclusion of this project, the performance of the developed materials and the resulting manufacturing improvement will be demonstrated on both 8-inch and 12-inch formats. The process begins with conventional photolithography on a chemically amplified resist to define a relief pattern. A Trencher material is then coated on top of and diffused into the pattern, creating a self-aligned layer of polarity-switched material at the sidewalls of the resist. A Masker is then applied to fill the openings in the pattern, and the final pitch-doubled pattern is revealed. The diffusion-controlled process achieves a similar result to alternative processes without the need for expensive tool upgrades.The technology can extend canonical lithography methods by up to 2 nodes, reduce production costs by more than 80%, and reduce patterning errors to improve yield. Importantly, the process is applicable to 8-inch wafers, bringing advanced node dimensionality to older fabs._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "This broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop coatings for walls and ceilings that have climate-regulating properties, resulting in improved energy efficiency, durability, and comfort for buildings. Buildings account for around 40% of primary energy consumption in the United States, and while increasing insulation and airtightness can lower energy costs, this also increases vulnerability to moisture damage. Inadequate moisture management has significant costs, and over one third of U.S. structures experience damp conditions that promote the growth of harmful pollutants like mold and bacteria. Moreover, water is a major cause of failure of building materials. Multifunctional coatings provide a solution that can be incorporated in a straightforward manner into both new constructions and retrofits._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe architectural coatings to be developed in this project have commercial potential and will make a broad impact because they will provide a cost-effective solution to the interconnected challenges of humidity control, thermal efficiency, and moisture durability. The coatings use the high energy storage capacity of moisture storage materials, mimicking how plants use water to regulate their temperature through transpiration.The research will focus on optimizing the formulations of a primer and a topcoat so that they work together as a multifunctional material system capable of effectively managing the flows of water vapor and heat. A first function of the system is to provide directional control over vapor diffusion in the manner of a vapor diode.This diode will create a pumping effect that actively removes moisture from the wall cavity and enhances a building's durability. A second function of the coatings is to buffer the humidity in the building, which increases comfort. A final function is to store and release significant amounts of latent heat as water vapor evaporates and condenses within its structure, which reduces temperature fluctuations and energy consumption required for climate control._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to demonstrate the potential to increase (by 2%) wind-energy production from existing wind farms at very low cost. Combining networked, air-pressure sensors distributed on the landscape with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), the technology will empower wind farm operators with advance alerts of oncoming winds and gusts to preemptively adjust settings like blade pitch and turbine yaw. These adjustments will result in more wind energy production and less turbine damage. This technology will significantly increase energy revenues and decrease costs. In 2022, US wind farms produced 380 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy. If serving just half of existing plants, this technology could yield an additional 3.8 TWh of renewable energy and over $150 million to US wind energy sales annually. In the competitive wind industry, these revenues can greatly increase operating margins and help accelerate the growth of the industry and clean energy jobs. Using government emissions figures, this deployment would also avert 2.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GTCO2) over 20 years. This wind alert technology could also benefit solar tracker safety and increase safety at aerial vehicle ports and lift-crane operations._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show how wind can be measured and predicted 10–600 seconds in the future by combining a new sensor modality — distributed pressure sensors — with new machine learning (ML) models. Pressure sensors are far cheaper than wind sensors (e.g., Doppler LIDAR), but processing data from pressure sensors into predictions of the wind is complex. It is impossible to hand-code statistical models to predict turbine-height wind from ground-level pressure measurements. Instead, one may rely on learned ML models to make these predictions. Previous studies have used ML to model weather on regional or global scales, but this project is the first to create models for the much smaller and more demanding scales applicable to wind farm operation and to optimize for metrics important to wind farm operators. Because ML models have not yet been developed directly for combined pressure and wind data at this spatial and temporal scale, this project will combine advances in attention-based models (like Transformers) with advances in models that respect physical priors (like Hamiltonian Neural Networks) and will lead to a new form of sensing which will be far more accurate than was previously possible at this price point._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The market is projected to reach $35.8 billion by 2026, at an annual growth rate of 18.4%. End-users range from astronomy to agriculture, manufactures, and third-party integrators (e.g., drone companies). Current technologies are too costly or do not possess the size, weight, and power (SWAP) properties required for practical value delivery. Furthermore, in low light conditions or in applications that require aberration-free high-resolution images (e.g., defense-based imaging), current technologies on the market cannot meet customer requirements. This solution promises to solve these issues. Agriculture and defense are the two leading market applications and represent the primary entry points for this technology. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe intellectual merit of this project will enable a transformation in the spectroscopy and the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) market by enabling low-cost, superior image quality spectrographs. The product will be a novel spherical transmission grating spectrometer (STGS) for hyperspectral imaging. Preliminary STGS designs, invented in a collaboration with astronomers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Southern African Large Telescope employ a combination of a spherical mirror and a spherically-curved transmission grating to deliver fully aberration-corrected spectral images with no field distortion. Challenges to their production are the design, fabrication, and testing of this spherical volume phase holographic (VPH) grating. These spectrographs represent a new paradigm in optical spectrometer design, and the team has developed a suite of STGS designs that will allow them to build a new generation of distortion and aberration free spectrographs that are simple, small, and lightweight. The key objectives for this project are: 1) to develop a curved grating manufacturing processes to match design and market goals, 2) to design and fabricate a prototype testbed HSI for design validation and high-throughput quality testing, and 3) to create finalized optical designs for STGSs in the F/2 to F/2.5 range._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Today, medical imaging facilities operate expensive equipment but lack access to operational data and modern tools to monitor and use them more efficiently. The company is building a digital twin of radiology operations to continuously capture imaging operations, monitor them, suggest optimizations, and optimally schedule patients. Beyond reporting and scheduling capabilities, the models will allow the prediction of interventions in software for the evaluation and comparison of different scenarios in-silico without real-world experimentation. The more efficient use of scanners is expected, in turn, to potentially benefit the patient population as it will reduce the wait time for imaging, increase patient access, shorten imaging protocols, reduce sedation duration, reduce and predict delays, and ultimately improve the patient experience. The data unified in the digital twin will also open new avenues of research for radiologists and researchers. _x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThe proposed project aims at developing and testing key technological innovations underpinning our digital twin vision.

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance American and global healthcare through new technologies enabling clinical translation of gene therapies. One of the major unmet needs within biotechnology is a delivery technology that enables gene therapies to reach the desired organ within the body without raising an immune response. Recent advances have unlocked many potential treatments for genetic diseases, but their use in the clinic is hampered by a lack of delivery technologies. This project will validate a new non-viral platform for this purpose and apply it to commercial use in a rare disease indication. The project provides a gene replacement therapy for Urea Cycle Disorder patients, who are currently treated using a combination of drugs and diet that shows limited effectiveness. Their regimens require up to 40 pills per day in combination with incredibly strict dietary control to avoid consuming too much protein. Even still, elevated blood ammonia results in neurological damage and high neonatal mortality. Caregivers face significant burdens of care to monitor diet, supplements, and medications. A gene replacement therapy that provides true disease correction would be transformational for patients and caregivers. _x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThe proposed project will result in the development of a gene replacement therapy that can be safely and repeatedly dosed to patients suffering from the class of rare diseases known as Urea Cycle Disorders. These patients lack an enzyme of the urea cycle that cannot be delivered exogenously. An alternative therapeutic approach is to deliver instructions, in the form of nucleic acids such as mRNA, for cells in the body to make the missing enzyme. The commercially proven methods of doing this – lipid nanoparticles and viral vectors – fail in this indication due to toxicity, immunogenicity, and dosing challenges. The platform developed in this project provides a means to overcome these limitations using a non-viral, polymer-lipid hybrid formulation. The scope of the project includes both pharmacology and toxicology studies in rodent models of the Urea Cycle Disorder Citrullinemia Type I, that will produce a pre-clinical data package supporting further development. Successful project execution will include formulation optimization and pre-clinical demonstration of disease correction (reduced blood ammonia levels) with a strong safety profile._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercialization potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will facilitate the development of the next generation of vertical transportation within the ever-taller skyscrapers of future urban centers. Successful commercialization will enhance the economic competitiveness of the United States in an expanding $26 billion market for elevators with “smart” technologies. The resulting products will allow building owners to meet their intra-building transportation needs of throughput and ride quality with fewer elevator shafts, freeing up more valuable lettable space within building cores. Aside from this and other value propositions delivered to the target customer segments, these products could reduce urban sprawl and the carbon footprints of buildings that utilize them, enhancing the quality of life for citizens of densely populated cities. Further, technologies developed as part of this project may be applied to other sustainable industries, such as electric vehicles and energy storage. _x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThe intellectual merit includes the development and verification of all core subsystems required for a complete vertical transportation system built around a novel dynamic tractive drive technology. This research will be conducted in four primary phases. First, a revised tractive drive unit (TDU) will be created that repackages the initial proof-of-concept design into a more compact and efficient mechanism that also fully implements both an active suspension and parking brake. Next, a complete elevator cab prototype will be constructed that incorporates four of the new TDUs, a proprietary control system, and all standard off-the-shelf electromechanical systems required for a passenger elevator cab. Third, a lateral transfer station (LTS) prototype will be constructed, which will allow cabs to transfer between adjacent shafts (and thus “circulate” within a building), a key feature of the eventual system. Each of these subsystems will be validated individually, and these experiments will culminate in the fourth phase of the project: repeated travel of the prototype cab to designated “stops” with all normal elevator operations, as well as fully-automated LTS docking and transfer._x000D_\r\n_x000D_\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These simulants must be produced by re-creating the natural formation processes on the Moon and other worlds as closely as possible under very controlled conditions.Icy simulants must be custom-made and can include hazardous gases so they are expensive and can only be produced slowly in small batches.Cryogenic shipment after production is expensive, difficult, and limited to small amounts. This project will produce new equipment and methods of production that are portable.The solution will also make more realistic and complete icy regolith simulants in quantities large enough for effective research and development to take place.The equipment will be designed to be adaptable and have the capacity to make various physical forms of icy simulants with differing ingredients._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a nanotechnology-based coating to combat the rise in Healthcare Acquired Infections (HAIs). HAIs spread in hospitals through healthcare workers’ hands and exposed surfaces. The coating technology developed through this project will disinfect surfaces contaminated with viruses and bacteria.The antimicrobial coating provides protection on these surfaces between cleanings. In the United States, 1 in 25 patients get a preventable HAI from hospital visits. HAIs cost hospitals an estimated $40 billion annually to treat. Commercialization of this technology will lead to fewer preventable illnesses and deaths, while decreasing the financial burden on the healthcare system for each HAI case. Other markets that will benefit from this work include businesses impacted by norovirus (stomach flu) such as cruise ships, restaurants, schools, nursing homes, chip manufacturing facilities, and food processing plants. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis project develops a novel, nanoparticle-enabled coating to combat the rise in HAIs. A novel nanoparticle with a high output of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and potent antimicrobial behavior has been developed. Because the antimicrobial mechanism is a secondary surface reaction, the technology can effectively deactivate viruses and bacteria without being consumed. Phase I demonstrations were achieved using bench top batches of nanoparticles. Phase II research and development creates a manufacturing process appropriate for the synthesis of the novel nanoparticles, creating a shelf stable formulated product, while ensuring the advances in nanoparticle production and formulation do not degrade the nanoparticle's antimicrobial efficacy. The synthesis allows for a decrease in the nanoparticle cost at scale.Shelf stability of the formulated product is important to the overall logistics and supply chain of the product. Improvements to both the scaled synthesis and formulation chemistry will be evaluated for impacts to the disinfection efficacy of the final product._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in technologies have shown great potential for widespread use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in real-time Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. However, the massive amounts of data collected and generated from ITS sensors pose a major challenge in data processing and transmission. This requires a shift from centralized repositories and cloud computing to edge computing. This project proposes an integrated low-power edge-computing system to work with computation-intensive traffic sensors (e.g., video, high-resolution radar, and Lidar) and weather sensors. The system will be designed to be portable, have self-diagnostic capabilities through monitoring sensors and system operations, and send out alerts and data when necessary. The proposed system will include an edge server, which will be developed based on a System-on-Module (SoM) using the latest AI chip, and an innovative hybrid camera that integrates a regular video camera and a FLIR thermal image camera. The project will identify and implement in-situ information processing and extraction algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify vehicles and detect events such as vehicle crashes, the presence of stopped vehicles, pavement and environmental conditions, and wildlife. The prototype will be demonstrated at a California test site in collaboration with Caltrans.",

        "abstract": "One million eighty-five thousand five hundred and seven (1,085,507) barrels of hazardous liquids spilled in the US between 2003 and 2022. Accidents involving tankers, barges, pipelines, refineries, drilling rigs, and storage facilities cause these hazardous chemical spills. Careful management of these sites is vital to prevent hazardous materials from causing harm to humans, wildlife, or ecological systems, both on and offsite. Bioremediation is a promising technology for the cleanup of hazardous materials spills. Ongoing research and development aim to improve its effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability to various contaminated sites. The research on encapsulated microbes gained considerable attention in recent years as encapsulation enhances the efficacy of microbes and their survival in harsh environmental conditions. Phase I research aims to develop a novel bioremediation product with improved microbial stability, higher selectivity towards absorbing hydrocarbons than traditional sorbent-based products, a higher rate of bioremediation, and a decrease in cost. Phase I results will provide a more profound understanding of the proposed solution and strengthen the commercial feasibility.",
