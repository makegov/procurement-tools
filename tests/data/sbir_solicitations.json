Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors/Principal Investigators and/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.\r\n\r\nThe NIAMS/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic, and skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives and Scope\r\n\r\nThis initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews, or other procedures of clinical research.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.\r\n\r\nNIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions\r\n\r\nDevelopment of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs\r\n\r\nBiomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology, or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis\r\n\r\nDevelopment of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials\r\n\r\nDevelopment of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and/or testing new therapeutics\r\n\r\nCollaboration Between Academic/Non-profit Lab and SBCs\r\n\r\nCommercialization of academic/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers, especially women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons, to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.\r\n\r\nMilestones\r\n\r\nNIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan's objectives in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and/or efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.\r\n\r\nApplications Not Responsive to This FOA\r\n\r\nExamples of research that are not responsive to this FOA include:\r\n\r\napplications that propose research and development that is not originated from an academic/non-profit lab\r\napplications that propose to conduct intervention studies\r\nNon-responsive applications will be returned without review.","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2265725","subtopics":[]}]},{"solicitation_title":"Industrialization and Translation of Extracellular Vesicles for use in Regenerative Medicine (U43/U44 Clinical Trials Not Allowed)","solicitation_number":"PAR-23-267","program":"SBIR","phase":"BOTH","agency":"Department of Health and Human Services","branch":"National Institutes of Health","solicitation_year":"2023","release_date":"2023-04-18","open_date":"2023-05-06","close_date":"2025-06-07","application_due_date":["2023-06-06","2024-06-06","2025-06-06"],"occurrence_number":null,"sbir_solicitation_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2388079","solicitation_agency_url":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/PA-files/PAR-23-267.html","current_status":"open","solicitation_topics":[{"topic_title":"Industrialization and Translation of Extracellular Vesicles for use in Regenerative Medicine (U43/U44 Clinical Trials Not Allowed)","branch":"National Institutes of Health","topic_number":"PAR-23-267","topic_description":"Purpose\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I and Phase II (Fast track and Direct to phase II) grant applications. The funding opportunity will utilize a U43/U44 cooperative agreement to support SBCs to propose the development of novel extracellular vesicle-based therapeutic platforms for use in regenerative medicine. This FOA is focused on the development of platforms associated with the production, manufacturing, and use, of native or engineered EVs as therapeutics. The EV products should have therapeutic applications in the area of tissue and organ repair in regenerative medicine..\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous membrane-enclosed carriers of bioactive protein, lipids and nucleic acids that are used for intercellular communication. The term, extracellular vesicles, is a generic term used for particles released from the cell that are delimited by a lipid bilayer that cannot replicate. However, there are multiple EVs subpopulations that can be differentiated based on criteria, including: size, biogenesis, release pathways, cargo, and function. EVs are released by virtually all cell types and EV-based intercellular communication takes place during normal cell homeostasis, or as a consequence of pathological development. EVs can cross biological barriers, can be modified to load molecular drugs, have few known deleterious effects and are relatively non-immunogenic, and can maintain their activity during storage. Several NIH programs have supported studies to understand the biology of EVs, and exosomes, and their potential use as therapeutics and diagnostics. This includes the NIH Common Fund's Extracellular RNA Communication Program (https://commonfund.nih.gov/exrna, which aimed to develop novel tools and technologies for the isolation and analysis of single EVs. However, there are a number of challenges in the use of EVs as therapeutics, including, but is not limited to, the production of sufficient quantities of EVs for therapeutic use, labor-intensive EV isolation procedures that are often not compatible with large-scale GMP manufacturing, and non-specific EV isolation methodologies. \r\n\r\nThe goal of regenerative medicine is to regain or restore damaged or lost function of tissues and organs. The NIH Common Fund's Regenerative Medicine program (https://commonfund.nih.gov/stemcells) concluded in 2020 and aimed to accelerate breakthroughs in the development of stem cell-based therapies for complex diseases. In addition to developing a clinical-grade, current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) iPSC line, this program established the Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) (https://ncats.nih.gov/stemcell), within the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) with the goal of bringing induced pluripotent stem cell technologies closer to clinical applications. Despite these successes, major challenges remain in regenerative medicine, particularly in tissue regeneration and repair.\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous studies demonstrating the ability of EVs as potential regenerative entities, particularly for their role in the repair and regeneration of various organs and tissue types. Recent studies have demonstrated that native EVs derived from stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have inherent therapeutic potential. EVs are able to affect cell phenotype, recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation in a paracrine manner resulting in many potential applications in the field of regenerative medicine. Engineered EVs can be loaded with cargo such as small molecule therapeutics, genetic modifications, and surface markers modified for specific therapeutic targeting. Many diseases could benefit from novel EV-based therapeutics. However, this FOA will focus on tissue and organ repair, and wound healing within regenerative medicine to address current challenges in the field, and to harness the advances made in regenerative medicine from previously funded NIH programs. It is anticipated that the use of non-living cellular products, such as EVs, for applications in regenerative medicine will lead to better translation into the clinic. \r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I and Phase II (Fast track and Direct to phase II) grant applications. The funding opportunity will utilize a U43/U44 cooperative agreement to support SBCs to propose the development of novel extracellular vesicle-based therapeutic platforms for use in regenerative medicine.

The EV products should have therapeutic applications in the area of tissue and organ repair in regenerative medicine.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous membrane-enclosed carriers of bioactive protein, lipids and nucleic acids that are used for intercellular communication. The term, extracellular vesicles, is generic term used for particles released from the cell that are delimited by a lipid bilayer that cannot replicate. However, there are multiple EVs subpopulations that can be differentiated based on a criteria including: size, biogenesis, release pathways, cargo, and function. EVs are released by virtually all cell types and EV-based intercellular communication take place during normal cell homeostasis, or as a consequence of pathological development. EVs can cross biological barriers, can be modified to load molecular drugs, have few known deleterious effects and are relatively non-immunogenic, and can maintain their activity during storage. Several NIH programs have supported studies to understand the biology of EVs, and exosomes, and their potential use as therapeutics and diagnostics. This includes the NIH Common Fund's Extracellular RNA Communication Program (https://commonfund.nih.gov/exrna) which aimed to develop novel tools and technologies for the isolation and analysis of single EVs. However, there are a number of challenges in the use of EVs as therapeutics. This includes (but is not limited to) the production of sufficient quantities of EVs for therapeutic use, labor-intensive EV isolation procedures that are often not compatible with large-scale GMP manufacturing, and non-specific EV isolation methodologies. \r\n\r\nThe goal of regenerative medicine is to regain or restore damaged or lost function of tissues and organs.

Data shows an increase in overdoses due to natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids, predominantly fentanyl, and psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine or cocaine. In fact, in the year ending in April 2021, fentanyl was the leading cause of death for adults ages 18-45, more than car accidents, suicide, COVID, and cancer. The scope and complexity of the current drug crisis are staggering, and there is an urgent need for a comprehensive effort to offer new medical products to the affected individuals, families, and communities. Scientific advances and product development based on those scientific advances can provide solutions to help overcome the crisis. For example, medical products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including pharmacotherapeutics and medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, offer promising means to monitor, diagnose, and treat patients suffering from opioid use disorders (OUD) and stimulant use disorders (StUD).\r\n\r\nThere are currently five pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating OUD and mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms: methadone, buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, naloxone, and lofexidine. While these effective medications exist, they are underutilized due, partly, to patient retention in treatment regimens, policy barriers that limit the prescription of medications approved for the treatment of OUD, and stigma around opioid agonist medications. Recent data from SAMHSA (2020) shows that only a minimal percentage of patients affected by substance use disorders, including OUD/StUD, receive any treatment. Moreover, given the diverse nature of OUD, patients may have limited responses to available medications, and additional options could benefit more patients. There are currently no FDA-approved medications for StUD, including cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there are currently five medical devices intended for patients suffering from substance use disorders cleared by the FDA. The list includes percutaneous or transcutaneous nerve stimulation devices designed to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal in conjunction with standard medications. The FDA also approved software as medical device solutions, also known as digital therapeutics, intended to deliver behavioral therapy to SUD patients as an adjunct to clinician-supervised treatment. While these technologies offer essential solutions for patients affected by SUD, significant constraints still limit patients' access. Examples of such restrictions include lack of FDA-cleared devices with specific indications for patients affected by StUD, lack of devices intended as a stand-alone treatment, lack of devices approved for use in patients under 18 years of age, and reduced adoption due to limited payor reimbursement. Additionally, existing FDA-cleared diagnostic devices for OUD/StUD are limited, and there are no wearable devices intended to monitor or diagnose OUD/StUD.\r\n\r\nThis funding opportunity announcement strives to contribute to the emergence of new solutions by seeking applications to conduct research and development activities for novel medical products which would address the needs of patients suffering from OUD/StUD. Investigators and developers of biomedical technologies that lead to the prevention, monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of OUD/StUD are highly encouraged to apply. Applications received under this FOA may fall within two FDA-regulated technical/scientific areas: (1) pharmacotherapeutics (small molecules and biologics) and (2) medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, including software as a medical device. Small business companies that developed currently marketed technologies or are developing technologies for different indications and are interested in demonstrating that their FDA-regulated product has a potential application in the OUD/StUD space are especially encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nArea 1: OUD/StUD pharmacotherapeutics\r\n\r\nProjects proposed under Area 1 may include but are not limited to developing the following categories of pharmacotherapeutics for OUD/StUD:\r\n\r\nSmall or large molecule agents.\r\nBiologics, including antibodies and therapeutic vaccines.\r\nNatural products.\r\nLonger-acting formulations of existing addiction medications.\r\nLonger-acting formulations of agonists or antagonists, e.g., longer-lasting naloxone formulations and new medications.\r\nAdvanced drug delivery systems.\r\nDevelopment and characterization of biomarkers.\r\nPharmacotherapeutics modalities other than those listed above may also be considered.\r\n\r\nApplications may include the following activities and steps in the R&D process:\r\n\r\nTarget identification or validation.\r\nAssay development, confirmation of hits, and hit to lead studies.\r\nLead optimization of compound(s) or biologic(s).\r\nIn vivo pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicology studies.\r\nIn vivo preclinical efficacy studies.\r\nFormulation development studies.\r\nProcess development to support clinical manufacturing (e.g., scale-up feasibility).\r\nOther activities leading to the selection of a development candidate.\r\nSpecific proposed objectives will vary among applications. Appropriate objectives in Area 1 include but are not necessarily limited to the following examples:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of in vitro pharmacological assays that cover a broad range of targets, including receptors, ion channels, transporters, enzymes, and secondary messengers to identify lead compounds, to define the mechanism of action, and to identify off-target activities.\r\nCompletion of in vivo preclinical efficacy studies.\r\nDemonstration of acceptable safety (e.g., toxicity in rodents and/or large animals).\r\nManufacturing of acceptable clinical dosage form [e.g., meeting Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) quality].\r\nClinical Proof of Concept (Phase I and/or Phase II clinical trials).\r\nApplicants should propose and conduct activities that will eventually lead to the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, as well as clinical studies to support the filing of either a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biological License Application (BLA). Applications may include biomarkers that assess the probability of OUD/StUD or allow an assessment of the treatment trajectory in patients under treatment for OUD/StUD.\r\n\r\nRecently issued FDA guidance on OUD: \u201cendpoints for demonstrating effectiveness of drugs for treatment guidance for industry\u201d (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/opioid-use-disorder-endpoints-demonstrating-effectiveness-drugs-treatment-guidance-industry) is a valuable resource in guiding R&D activities. For OUD, the proposed drug product must have a clear advantage over existing competing products and a clearly defined path with the ultimate goal of commercialization. Therefore, applicants are encouraged to establish a Target Product Profile (TPP) for the proposed products (https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20190907022334/https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/target-product-profile-strategic-development-process-tool).\r\n\r\nArea 2: Medical therapeutic and diagnostic devices, including software as a medical device\r\n\r\nProjects proposed under Area 2 may include, but are not necessarily limited to, research and development of the following categories of medical devices:\r\n\r\nImaging technologies for investigating brain function and enhancing the diagnosis of OUD/StUD.\r\nDevices that directly diagnose and reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms or increase retention in outpatient therapies.\r\nTherapeutic devices (e.g., neuromodulation) intended to improve OUD/StUD treatment outcomes and recurrence prevention.\r\nDevices, including digital therapeutics, intended to identify and treat newborns exposed to opioids and stimulants, along with other drugs, to improve both short- and long-term developmental outcomes; novel approaches to managing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).\r\nDevices intended for the treatment of pediatric patients (e.g., neonates, infants, adolescents) including use of extrapolation methods to treat pediatric patients following FDA\u2019s pediatric extrapolation guidance:https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/leveraging-existing-clinical-data-extrapolation-pediatric-uses-medical-devices.\r\nDevices, including digital therapeutics, with treatment indications for pregnant mothers suffering from OUD/StUD.\r\nIn vitro diagnostic assays such as Point-of-Care analytical tools for blood, saliva, or urine (e.g., lab-on-a-chip biosensors that allow remote performance of chemical or biological assays outside of a laboratory environment).\r\nStand-alone or adjunctive digital therapeutics (e.g., Software as a Medical Device, Software in Medical Device) focused on behavioral health interventions to diagnose, treat, prevent, and mitigate OUD/StUD.\r\nDevices, including wearables and connected digital therapeutics at point-of-care, intended to detect, diagnose, and treat opioid-induced respiratory depression.\r\nData science and cloud-based technologies empowered by artificial intelligence intended to collect, integrate, analyze, and visualize multimodal data related to diagnosis/treatment of OUD/StUD, including disorder progression and risk of recurrence.\r\nTechnologies that integrate sensors, wearables, environmental and social factors to analyze behavior patterns, social interactions, ecological momentary assessment of triggers, and identifying stress responses to personalize just-in-time treatment interventions.\r\nFor projects in Area 2, applicants should propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of FDA premarket application for clearance/approval (e.g., 510(k) or DeNovo application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application). Such activities include early engagement with the FDA Center of Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) via the presubmission program to receive feedback on proposed intended use, preclinical testing, and study design protocols. Please see for reference the FDA Q-submission guidance:https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\r\n\r\nAdditional specific proposed activities may include, but are not limited to, the following examples:\r\n\r\nStudies supporting an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, where applicable, for significant risk devices (see https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/investigational-device-exemption-ide/ide-application).\r\nProcess development for manufacturing.\r\nNon-clinical safety studies (e.g., toxicology, biocompatibility, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety).\r\nSafety studies in animal models.\r\nClinical trials.\r\nNon-Responsive Activities\r\n\r\nThe following activities will be considered non-responsive:\r\n\r\nApplications solely focused on disorders other than OUD/StUD (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders), as defined in the DSM-5.\r\nApplications pursuing non-FDA-regulated products.\r\nApplications pursuing FDA-regulated medical products for pain as a sole focus without addressing OUD/StUD monitoring, diagnosis, treatment, overdose prevention, and/or reversal.\r\nWords Matter\r\n\r\nDrug addiction is a chronic but treatable disorder with well-understood genetic and social contributors. NIDA encourages preferred language that accurately describes addiction and substance use in all submitted materials without perpetuating stigma and bias. Research shows that using person-first language\u2014such as \"person with a substance use disorder\"\u2014instead of \"substance abuser\" or \"addict\" can reduce negative associations and punitive attitudes among clinicians and researchers. Further, the term \"substance abuse\" has no clinical relevance, as it is no longer included in the DSM-5 terminology. Instead, NIDA encourages the use of \"addiction\" or \"substance use disorders\" or other specific terminology, such as \"opioid use disorders,\" \"cocaine use disorders,\" as included in the DSM-5. In addition to using person-first language, NIDA recommends avoiding the term \"substance abuse\" and its derivatives in favor of \"use,\" \"misuse,\" or \"use disorder(s)\" where appropriate. Similarly, \"abuse potential\" may be replaced with \"addiction liability.\"\r\n\r\nNIDA encourages using the term \"medications for opioid use disorder\" (MOUD) instead of \"medication-assisted treatment\" (MAT) or \"opioid substitution therapy\" (OST) when referring to medications prescribed for the treatment of OUD. The term MOUD appropriately frames these life-saving medications as effective, frontline treatments. In contrast, the term MAT implies that medication should have a supplemental or temporary role in treatment. OST reinforces the misconception that MOUD \"substitutes\" one drug for another instead of supporting recovery. The terminology shift to MOUD aligns with the way other psychiatric medications are understood (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics) as critical tools central to a patient's treatment plan.\r\n\r\nThese small but powerful substitutions may help address stigma in patients and study participants, which research shows reduces willingness to seek and accept treatment, among other adverse health outcomes.

In contrast, the SBIR Phase II objective is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization.\r\n\r\nBeyond the scope of this FOA, it is anticipated and encouraged that the outcomes of successful SBIR projects will help attract strategic partners or investors to support the ultimate commercialization of the technology as a publicly available product or service.\r\n\r\nThis FOA invites four types of applications:\r\n\r\nPhase I. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts and determine the quality of performance of the small business awardee organization before proceeding to Phase II.\r\n\r\nPhase II. The objective of Phase II is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I. Funding is based on the results achieved in Phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the project proposed in Phase II. Therefore, NIDA evaluates that investigators have established technical and commercial feasibility in Phase I before deciding on Phase II support.\r\n\r\nFast Track. In an NIH SBIR fast-track both Phase I and Phase II are submitted and reviewed as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases. Fast-Track (Phase I/ Phase II) applications should include a clear rationale of the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed approach and technology in the OUD/StUD area; demonstrate a high probability of commercialization; include clear, appropriate, measurable, clinically meaningful milestones to be achieved before initiating Phase II; and indicate potential Phase III support/interest (non-SBIR) from future commercialization partners. The objective of Phase II (as a part of Fast Track applications) is to continue the R&D efforts initiated in Phase I to advance technologies to potential commercialization. Projects proposed for Phase II are based on the results achieved in Phase I (or equivalent) and aim to demonstrate scientific and technical merit and commercial potential. Therefore, NIDA evaluates that investigators have established technical and commercial feasibility in Phase I and that proposed milestones are met before deciding on Phase II support.\r\n\r\nDirect to Phase II. NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award for a small business that has already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but has not received a Phase I award for that project. The NIH Direct to Phase II will accept Phase II submissions regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Small businesses eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects supported with a Phase I SBIR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.\r\n\r\nFirst-time applicants may submit a Phase I, Fast-Track, or Direct-to-Phase II application.\r\n\r\nSpecial Considerations\r\n\r\nNational Advisory Council on Drug Abuse Recommended Guidelines for the Administration of Drugs to Human Subjects: The National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) recognizes the importance of research involving the administration of drugs with abuse potential and dependence or addiction liability to human subjects. Therefore, potential applicants are encouraged to obtain and review these recommendations of the Council before submitting an application that will administer compounds to human subjects. The guidelines are available on NIDA's Web site at http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/clinical-research/nacda-guidelines-administration-drugs-to-human-subjects.\r\n\r\nPoints to Consider Regarding Tobacco Industry Funding of NIDA Applicants: The National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) encourages NIDA and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth concerning existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on NIDA's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. For additional details, please see https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/advisory-boards-groups/national-advisory-council-drug-abuse-nacda/points-to-consider-regarding-tobacco-industry-funding-nida-applicants.\r\n\r\nData Harmonization for Substance Abuse and Addiction via the PhenX Toolkit: NIDA strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and do so by incorporating the measures from the Core and Specialty collections, which are available in the Substance Abuse and Addiction Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). Please see NOT-DA-12-008 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-12-008.html) for further details.\r\n\r\nEstablishment of a Standard delta-9-THC Unit to be used in Research:\r\n\r\nApplications proposing research on cannabis or its main psychotropic constituent delta-9-THC are required to measure and report results using a standard delta-9-THC unit in all applicable human subjects\u2019 research. The goal is to increase the comparability across cannabis research studies. A standard delta-9-THC unit is defined as any formulation of cannabis plant material or extract that contains 5 milligrams of delta-9-THC. A justification should be provided for human research that does not propose to use the standard unit.

The need for additional medications to treat those affected by AUD is urgently needed.In addition,alcohol misuseaffects virtually all tissues and is linked with dysfunction and failure of many organs and systems including the liver, heart, pancreas, lung, bone, and skeletal muscle, as well as digestive, vascular, endocrine, and immune systems.There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for alcohol-associated organ damage (AAOD) so effectivetherapies to prevent and treat AAOD are urgently needed.\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to provide support to SBC for the optimization, development, and translation of pharmaceutical research discoveries into new treatments for disorders that fall under the mission of NIAAA.The goal is to advance small molecules, natural products or biologics for AUD and AAOD through the drug development pipeline towards FDA approval and ultimately, commercialization.\r\n\r\nDue to the urgency of this public health need, projects supporting a lead compound with a robust body of background data in the basic science and early discovery phases to be poised for transition to the preclinical and clinical phases of medications development will be prioritized. Background data may include rigorous preclinical testing, sufficient bioactivity, stability, manufacturability, bioavailability, and in vivo efficacy and/or target engagement. Applications focusing solely on basic science research such as: novel target identification/validation, generation of new animal models, development/testing of new human laboratory models, assay development, new biomarkers, or mechanistic studies of the neurobiology of AUD are not considered responsive. By the end of the funding period, projects are expected to achieve milestones that significantly move the compound towards the next phase of drug development (e.g., pre-IND meeting, Investigational New Drug (IND) application).\r\n\r\nWomen-owned and socially or economically disadvantaged small business are encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\r\n\r\nThis FOA seeks applications that propose to advance the following classes of therapeutics beyond pre-clinical development by preparing to seek regulatory approval for future trials: small molecules, natural products, and biologics, which broadly include peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, and cell therapies.

Applications seeking to supportonlyearly-stage clinical trials with preliminary POC efficacy and safety data supported outside the SBIR/STTR program, may apply for a Direct to Phase II under this FOA.\r\n\r\nSmall, early-phase clinical trials that are appropriate include:\r\n\r\nProof-of-Concept\r\nPilot studies\r\nSafety and Efficacy testing in a larger sample of human subjects\r\nMilestones\r\n\r\nBecause therapy development is an inherently high-risk process, it is anticipated that there may be significant attrition as projects move through the therapy development process. Milestones are goals that are quantifiable for measuring success that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative criteria associated with them (see Section IV.2 for details).\r\n\r\nNIAAA intends to only move forward agents that are both efficacious and safe. Although the primary goals are to assess safety and toxicology, lack of evidence of a trend towards efficacy in the dose range where the candidate is safe can also be a consideration for discontinuation.\r\n\r\nU44 Phase I/II transition\r\n\r\nApplicants can submit separate Phase I (U43) or Phase II (U44) applications. However, if Phase I and Phase II are submitted together in one application (U44 Fast-Track), then an administrative review will be conducted by NIAAA Program staff to decide whether a project will be considered for transition from the Phase I to the Phase II. Phase II eligible projects must have a candidate that has been manufactured with satisfactory purity and stability, verified to have activity in vivo and/or in vitro as necessary, have bioavailability with a proper formulation, and have a good preliminary safety profile.\r\n\r\nPrior to commencement of the clinical trial (defined as first subject signature on an informed consent form), the applicant must provide the following to NIAAA for review and/or approval.\r\n\r\nInvestigational Review Board (IRB) approval;\r\nIRB approved Study protocol and Informed Consent;\r\nFDA IND or IND waiver;\r\nNew or revised/updated data and safety monitoring plan;\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Board configuration and charter;\r\nAgreement with NIAAA staff on updated timeline, milestones and budget for clinical trial\r\nNIAAA approval of protocol and safety monitoring plan\r\nQuality and Compliance Requirements\r\n\r\nSince the goal of this program is to generate therapeutics which will be eligible for FDA approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that all IND-enabling nonclinical studies will be performed in a manner consistent with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).\r\nInvestigational products should be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Bioassays such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics or immunogenicity should, when possible, be performed under GLP guidelines.\r\nAll clinical trials must be performed following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and be in accord with NIAAA Policy.\r\nIntellectual Property (IP)\r\n\r\nSince the ultimate goal of the SBIR/STTR program is to bring new therapies to the market/patients, the program strongly encourages the awardees and/or their collaborators to obtain and retain any IP developed around the therapy during the project period (see instructions on attachment of letters to address IP issues in Section IV.2). Awardees are encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the therapy development process. PDs/PIs are expected to work closely with their institutional technology transfer officials to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project.

The need for additional medications to treat those affected by AUD is urgently needed.In addition,alcohol misuseaffects virtually all tissues and is linked with dysfunction and failure of many organs and systems including the liver, heart, pancreas, lung, bone, and skeletal muscle, as well as digestive, vascular, endocrine, and immune systems.There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for alcohol-associated organ damage (AAOD) so effectivetherapies to prevent and treat AAOD are urgently needed.\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to provide support to SBC for the optimization, development, and translation of pharmaceutical research discoveries into new treatments for disorders that fall under the mission of NIAAA.The goal is to advance small molecules, natural products or biologics for AUD and AAOD through the drug development pipeline towards FDA approval and ultimately, commercialization.\r\n\r\nDue to the urgency of this public health need, projects supporting a lead compound with a robust body of background data in the basic science and early discovery phases to be poised for transition to the preclinical and clinical phases of medications development will be prioritized. Background data may include rigorous preclinical testing, sufficient bioactivity, stability, manufacturability, bioavailability, and in vivo efficacy and/or target engagement. Applications focusing solely on basic science research such as: novel target identification/validation, generation of new animal models, development/testing of new human laboratory models, assay development, new biomarkers, or mechanistic studies of the neurobiology of AUD are not considered responsive. By the end of the funding period, projects are expected to achieve milestones that significantly move the compound towards the next phase of drug development (e.g., pre-IND meeting, Investigational New Drug (IND) application).\r\n\r\nWomen-owned and socially or economically disadvantagedsmall business are encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nResearch Objectives\r\n\r\nThis FOA seeks applications that propose to advance the following classes of therapeutics beyond pre-clinical development by preparing to seek regulatory approval for future trials: small molecules, natural products, and biologics, which broadly include peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, and cell therapies. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIAAA Scientific/Research staff regarding the agent under development, to determine the fit for the FOA prior to submission\r\n\r\nExamples of responsive drug development activities and corresponding STTR Phase assignment includes but is not limited to,\r\n\r\nPre-clinical development \u2013 STTR Phase I (Proof of Concept Phase)\r\n\r\n-Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) activities (e.g., master and working banks development, purification development, CMC analytical development, formulation development, scale-up manufacturing or cGMP manufacturing) for IND-enabling pharmacology/toxicology tests\r\nPharmacokinetic evaluations in species relevant for toxicology or human dose-prediction\r\nPreliminary safety such as safety pharmacology and/or dose-range finding toxicology\r\nOptimizing and/or validation of appropriate assays for pharmacokinetics, bioactivity (potency), target engagement markers or other assays to monitor safety to be used in human trials\r\nDrug interaction studies between medication and alcohol\r\nFurther evaluation of compound safety/efficacy in established animal models,\r\nIND-enabling studies\r\nPre-clinical development \u2013 STTR Phase II (Research and Development)\r\n\r\nThe Phase II can support more extensive IND-enabling development activities.\r\n\r\nIND-enabling toxicology, with toxicokinetics, if applicable\r\nTumorigenicity evaluations particularly for gene therapies and cell therapies, if applicable\r\nImmunogenicity evaluations, if applicable\r\nBiodistribution studies, if applicable\r\nLarge animal study to assess biocompatibility of means of clinical delivery of the candidate, if applicable\r\nValidation of appropriate assays such as for target engagement markers to enable human use\r\nIND and other regulatory submissions\r\n\r\nClinical development \u2013 STTR Phase I\r\n\r\nEvaluation of pharmacokinetics, preliminary safety, tolerability, alcohol interaction, dose-ranging, and/or initial efficacy in human subjects.\r\nClinical development - STTR Phase II\r\n\r\nFor more advanced projects, a small early phase clinical trial can also be supported when feasible during the Phase II. Applications seeking to supportonlyearly-stage clinical trials with preliminary POC efficacy and safety data supported outside the SBIR/STTR program, may apply for a Direct to Phase II under this FOA.\r\n\r\nSmall, early-phase clinical trials that are appropriate include:\r\n\r\nProof-of-Concept\r\nPilot studies\r\nSafety and Efficacy testing in a larger sample of human subjects\r\nMilestones\r\n\r\nBecause therapy development is an inherently high-risk process, it is anticipated that there may be significant attrition as projects move through the therapy development process. Milestones are goals that are quantifiable for measuring success that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project and should have quantitative criteria associated with them (see Section IV.2 for details).\r\n\r\nNIAAA intends to only move forward agents that are both efficacious and safe. Although the primary goals are to assess safety and toxicology, lack of evidence of a trend towards efficacy in the dose range where the candidate is safe can also be a consideration for discontinuation.\r\n\r\nUT2 Phase I/II transition\r\n\r\nApplicants can submit separate Phase I (UT1) or Phase II (UT2) applications. However, if Phase I and Phase II are submitted together in one application (UT2 Fast-Track), then an administrative review will be conducted by NIAAA Program staff to decide whether a project will be considered for transition from the Phase I to the Phase II. Phase II eligible projects must have a candidate that has been manufactured with satisfactory purity and stability, verified to have activity in vivo and/or in vitro as necessary, have bioavailability with a proper formulation, and have a good preliminary safety profile.\r\n\r\nPrior to commencement of the clinical trial (defined as first subject signature on an informed consent form), the applicant must provide the following to NIAAA for review and/or approval.\r\n\r\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) approval;\r\nIRB approved Study protocol and Informed Consent;\r\nFDA IND or IND waiver;\r\nNew or revised/updated data and safety monitoring plan;\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Board configuration and charter;\r\nAgreement with NIAAA staff on updated timeline, milestones and budget for clinical trial\r\nNIAAA approval of protocol and safety monitoring plan\r\nQuality and Compliance Requirements\r\n\r\nSince the goal of this program is to generate therapeutics which will be eligible for FDA approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that all IND-enabling nonclinical studies will be performed in a manner consistent with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).\r\nInvestigational products should be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Bioassays such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics or immunogenicity should, when possible, be performed under GLP guidelines.\r\nAll clinical trials must be performed following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and be in accord with NIAAA Policy.\r\nIntellectual Property (IP)\r\n\r\nSince the ultimate goal of the SBIR/STTR program is to bring new therapies to the market/patients, the program strongly encourages the awardees and/or their collaborators to obtain and retain any IP developed around the therapy during the project period (see instructions on attachment of letters to address IP issues in Section IV.2). Awardees are encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the therapy development process. PDs/PIs are expected to work closely with their institutional technology transfer officials to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project.

In this regard, ORIP plays a vital role through its support of research infrastructures and animal models of human diseases.\r\n\r\nWith this FOA, ORIP encourages applications from small business concerns (SBCs) for Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) projects to develop and implement novel tools and devices to improve animal welfare, to ease the management of individual animals and animal colonies, and to improve the monitoring and control of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, vibrations, and ultrasonic noise) which affect outcomes and reproducibility in animal model research.\r\n\r\nPoor reproducibility of experiments that use animal models has negatively impacted biomedical research for many decades. The difficulty of improving reproducibility can be realized when considering the broad range of intrinsic factors (e.g., age, species, health status, and sex) and extrinsic factors (e.g., climate, illumination, physical restraints, odors, and noise) that can affect the physiological and biological response of animals.\r\n\r\nThe variation of extrinsic factors between different animal facilities has been cited as a source of irreproducibility in animal research. Often, different laboratory animals require different environmental conditions for their optimal growth and well-being. Also, the amount and type of pathogens, or pollutants in a facility can influence the physiological response and welfare of animals. Even small differences in the handling and diets of animals can affect their physiological response. Accurate accounting for and monitoring of these factors can reduce variations between experiments and lead to improvements in animal model validations and translatability to human studies.\r\n\r\nTo consistently maintain an optimal environment for research animals, there is a need for devices in animal facilities that can precisely and accurately monitor the environmental conditions, especially those that are challenging to account for such as humidity, vibrations, odors, and ultrasonic noise. Ideally, these devices will facilitate innovative and efficient operational procedures that utilize novel and green technologies to control and optimize the environmental conditions in animal facilities.\r\n\r\nDevices that can sensitively identify types and levels of various pathogens, allergens, and/or other pollutants are especially desired in environments supporting laboratory animals.

These factors are especially hard to account for when comparing and monitoring species in the same and/or different geographical locations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, needed are noninvasive or minimally invasive bio-logging devices for real-time monitoring of the behavior, food/water consumption, and bodily functions of animals. Such devices should be discreet, robust, easy to apply, and mobile, while being sensitive enough to register the physiology of different animals. Not only should these devices aid in the study and management of individual animals or entire colonies, but they should also lead to improvements in the performance of research protocols and data analysis. To implement such goals, there is a simultaneous need for new software that can combine data from different types of monitoring devices while being compatible with different data formats and linkable to existing databases.\r\n\r\nNovel devices and tools are also needed to help ease the process of handling and restraining of animals. These devices should reduce the stress to both the animals and researcher; stress is an experimental variable and must be minimized. Importantly, these devices should bring improvements in the efficiency of animal-handling practices and experimental procedures.\r\n\r\nConnecting diet, environmental conditions, and physiological measurements will provide a global picture of the health and life-history of individual animals and colonies.

Nor are reagents and experimental protocols appropriate for this FOA.\r\n\r\nThe development and implementation of novel tools and devices, and enhancement of existing equipment includes, but are not limited to, the following specific examples:\r\n\r\nPortable and robust software to help manage (including husbandry protocol procedures and assessment) and evaluate animal colonies;\r\nReliable and discreet noninvasive or minimally invasive technology for the tracking and monitoring of animals, that either connect to or can easily communicate with existing formats and electronic management systems;\r\nNovel automated feeding systems, compatible with tagging and tracking devices to allow quantitation of feed consumption of individual animals;\r\nDevices and equipment to automate and support drug delivery by oral, subcutaneous, arterial, venous, or intracerebroventricular/intracerebral routes, and related methods to measure drug uptake and their technological implementation in species-specific devices;\r\nRobust and accurate devices for non-invasive measurement of physiological parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure in rodents and other model organism used in research;\r\nImproved systems for the collection of multi-source data (including telemetric and extrinsic variables) and their analysis for comprehensive behavioral assessment of animal models;\r\nBetter devices for phenotyping at the organismal as well as at the molecular levels;\r\nSafe and improved holding, restraining, and transfer devices for routine care, and for intra-facility transport such as large animal transfer chutes and nonhuman primate restraints;\r\nBetter air and water filters for metabolic cages, aquaria, and other animal facility equipment;\r\nBetter bedding materials (e.g., self-displaying levels of contaminants and microorganisms, odor-absorbent, recyclable) for animals;\r\nBetter and easy to use tools and devices to measure levels of pathogens and contaminants in cages, aquaria, and animal facilities;\r\nBetter devices/tools/equipment to sanitize and disinfect animal facilities and related equipment.\r\nApplicants are advised to discuss their projects with the Scientific/Research contacts before submitting an application.","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2142409","subtopics":[]}]},{"solicitation_title":"Blueprint Medtech: Small Business Translator (U44 - Clinical Trial Optional)","solicitation_number":"PAR-21-282","program":"SBIR","phase":"BOTH","agency":"Department of Health and Human Services","branch":"National Institutes of Health","solicitation_year":"2021","release_date":"2021-08-20","open_date":"2021-09-20","close_date":"2024-06-21","application_due_date":["2021-10-20","2022-02-18","2022-06-20","2022-10-18","2023-02-21","2023-06-20","2023-10-18","2024-02-20","2024-06-20"],"occurrence_number":null,"sbir_solicitation_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2075181","solicitation_agency_url":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-282.html","current_status":"open","solicitation_topics":[{"topic_title":"Blueprint Medtech: Small Business Translator (U44 - Clinical Trial Optional)","branch":"National Institutes of Health","topic_number":"PAR-21-282","topic_description":"Blueprint MedTech\r\n\r\nThe NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research is a collaborative framework through which 14 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices jointly support neuroscience-related research, with the aim of accelerating discoveries and reducing the burden of nervous system disorders (for further information, see http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/).\r\n\r\nInnovators developing groundbreaking medical device technologies face a number of challenges along the translational path from bench to bedside. The Blueprint MedTech program is an NIH incubator that aims to address such challenges and support the innovators by accelerating the development of cutting-edge medical devices to diagnose and treat disorders of the nervous system. The mission of the program is to catalyze the translation of novel neurotechnologies from early-stage development to first-in-human clinical studies. The program will provide: (a) non-dilutive funds to support medical device development activities led by investigators, and (b) additional resources and support services including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\nPlanning resources to support concept development, team building, needs assessment, and other early translational activities.\r\nStreamlined access to translational services and expertise (e.g., design and prototyping, bench testing, large animal testing, biocompatibility assessment, manufacturing, medical monitoring).\r\nAssistance from consultants (e.g., on regulatory, reimbursement, intellectual property, commercialization, and strategic partnership issues).\r\nAdvice from industry experts (e.g., meetings with an external oversight committee).\r\nThe overarching goal of the Blueprint MedTech program is to accelerate patient access to groundbreaking, safe, and effective medical devices. The program will provide support to sufficiently develop and de-risk technologies to the point where additional investments are warranted from industry partners, investors, and government.\r\n\r\nA. Overview\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support SBCs in pursuing translational activities and clinical studies to advance the development of therapeutic, and diagnostic devices for disorders that affect the nervous or neuromuscular systems. Activities supported by this FOA include implementation of clinical prototype devices, non-clinical safety and effectiveness testing, design verification and validation activities. Additional activities include obtaining an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for a Significant Risk (SR) study or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) study, as well as support for a subsequent clinical feasibility study. The clinical study is expected to provide information about the device function or final design that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use.\r\n\r\nAll projects will be submitted as SBIR Fast-Track applications.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I project will support non-clinical translational device activities to obtain an IDE and IRB approval for an SR clinical study, or to obtain IRB approval for an NSR clinical study. The duration of SBIR Phase I project will depend on the maturity of the project at entry and can last up to two years. The Phase II project will support a clinical study and can last up to three years. The total project period (including both phases) must not exceed five years. Projects for which only a clinical phase is proposed are outside of the scope of this funding opportunity. Only Phase I projects that have met specific criteria (see below) will be eligible for transition to Phase II after NIH administrative review. Furthermore, ethical considerations are intrinsic to the responsible conduct of neuroscience research and the translation of neuroscience advances (scientific and technological) into clinical practice. It is expected the immediate next steps following completion of the clinical feasibility study supported under this cooperative agreement will be:\r\n\r\na marketing application if only a clinical feasibility study or experience is needed to demonstrate the device is safe and effective.\r\na larger clinical trial that will lead to a marketing application, or\r\ndevice design decisions made based on the information and data collected.\r\nThis FOA will utilize a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) U44 cooperative agreement. As a cooperative agreement, this FOA supports milestone-driven projects and involves NIH program staff\u2019s participation in negotiating project and milestone plan before award, monitoring the research progress, and making go/no-go decisions. The expectations of the program are in line with those of industry regarding the advancement of devices through the developmental and translational pipelines. As such, an inherent rate of attrition is possible within this program.\r\n\r\nAn objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by socially and economically disadvantaged persons and women-owned small businesses. This PAR encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators,including team members that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?TopID=2&SubID=27 and the most recent report on Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering). Such individuals include those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds\r\n\r\nB. Scope\r\n\r\nProjects must focus on a disorder that falls within the mission of participating NIH Blueprint Institutes and Centers. It is expected that devices within the scope of this program either:\r\n\r\nare very close to the 'final system' and manufactured using very close to the same manufacturing process as the device to be marketed or studied in a larger clinical trial following the completion of this project; or\r\nhave received Pre-Submission feedback from the FDA (see FDA/CDRH Q-Submission website and CDRH-learn website, Q-submissions for additional resources); or\r\nrequire early feasibility clinical data to inform the final device design or manufacturing processes.\r\nC. Entry criteria\r\n\r\nApplicants to the Blueprint MedTech program must include novel medical device technologies that will advance upon current neurotechnology (see non-responsive criteria below).\r\n\r\nApplicants should clearly define the current state of the art and highlight how their proposed technology will advance patient care. Responsive applications should propose medical devices, expected to be regulated by the FDA, with first-of-its-kind technologies, unique and novel intended use, new safety questions, and/or new regulatory questions. Responsive applications may also pivot and refine existing technologies toward new intended use and/or use in novel settings (e.g., innovating and translating a neuromodulation device approved for healthcare-setting only to home-use).\r\n\r\nProposed medical devices and their indications will likely follow De Novo or Premarket Approval (PMA) regulatory pathways. Medical devices with indications that may fit within an existing 510(k) pathway may also be accepted, as long as the application can demonstrate a clear clinical and technological innovation beyond the state of the art of existing FDA-cleared predicates. Such devices should be reasonably expected to provide new clinically meaningful diagnostic or therapeutic options or improve the benefit-risk profile of a treatment or diagnostic through substantial safety innovations. It is recommended that applicants reach out to the NIH program staff listed at the bottom of this funding opportunity to discuss responsiveness criteria with respect to proposed technologies and indications.\r\n\r\nFor entry to the program, projects should have:\r\n\r\nComprehensive supporting data based on bench, in vitro, and/or in vivo models representative of the intended patient population and indication.\r\nIdentified one or more clinically meaningful device outcome measures based on input from key stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, patients, and caregivers) as well as supporting literature.\r\nA compelling case for a successful IDE submission for an SR study, or IRB approval for an NSR study at the end of SBIR Phase I. Required regulatory approvals for clinical studies must be received prior to the start of the SBIR Phase II.\r\nApplicants are encouraged, but not required, to consult with FDA via a Pre-Submission meeting, study risk designation request, and/or 513(g) submission prior to applying for funding through this grant mechanism. Applicants who do not have sufficiently relevant feedback from the FDA regarding all planned activities prior to application for funding will be expected to do so as the first milestone of the SBIR Phase I award. Funding may be restricted to a maximum of $100,000 in direct costs until FDA feedback that is consistent with the likely success of the regulatory path to market and overall device development plan outlined in the grant application is received. In the event that FDA feedback is not consistent with the plans in the grant, program staff will evaluate the concerns and change of scope that would be needed and work with the investigators to determine the most appropriate course of action. Any remaining funds associated with the original award will not be released.\r\n\r\nD. Phases\r\n\r\nSBIR Phase I scope:\r\n\r\nExamples of studies that may be proposed during SBIR Phase I include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nNon-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) animal studies to develop surgical techniques relevant to the device, optimize relevant therapeutic or diagnostic parameters, and refine device design as necessary for subsequent GLP testing or additional clinical studies for regulatory approval.\r\nBench-top and animal testing to demonstrate compliance with FDA Recognized Standards.\r\nGLP compliant large animal model safety and/or testing of an implanted device.\r\nActivities to become current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliant.\r\nActivities to bring the development process under Design and Quality Systems Control.\r\nStudies addressing usability/acceptability.\r\nDevice, software, firmware, and cybersecurity design verification and validation activities.\r\nDevelopment of packaging, connectors, and other accessories necessary for the translation of this technology.\r\nRegulatory activities, including pre-submission meetings with FDA, IDE submission, or other FDA regulatory submissions (e.g., Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), Request for Risk Designation, 513(g) submission).\r\nSBIR Phase II scope:\r\n\r\nSBIR Phase II will support a clinical study that will lead to either:\r\n\r\nA marketing application if the clinical study is sufficient to demonstrate device safety and effectiveness for regulatory approval, or\r\nA larger clinical study that will lead to a marketing application; or\r\nUse of the clinical experience to inform device design decisions\r\nExamples of studies that may be proposed during SBIR Phase II include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nOptimization of the device design with respect to the human functional anatomy.\r\nIdentification of the most simple, reliable, and cost-effective device configuration for more advanced clinical studies and eventual market approval.\r\nStudies of the key physiological variables that may impact the function of the device in humans.\r\nInitial assessments of device safety are expected, but only in conjunction with obtaining enabling data about device design or function\r\nE. Non-Responsive Activities\r\n\r\nApplications that include the following activities will be considered non-responsive and will be withdrawn and not reviewed:\r\n\r\nAnimal model development: all in vivo models must be established and characterized, and available to the applicant;\r\nEfforts to develop neurotechnology for fundamental study of the nervous system;\r\nFundamental basic/applied research projects that employ existing market approved devices for their labeled uses;\r\nProjects focused on technologies for augmentation of healthy individuals;\r\nDelayed-onset clinical studies;\r\nDevice technologies where the SBC does not have the needed intellectual property (IP) to enable further development/commercialization;\r\nDevice technologies not regulated by the FDA.\r\nApplications that do not include the following will also be considered incomplete:\r\n\r\nThe following other attahcments:\r\nGantt Chart,\r\nLong-term care plan,\r\nResource Checklist;\r\nA milestone plan;\r\nIt is recommended that applicants reach out to the NIH program staff listed at the bottom of this funding opportunity to discuss responsiveness criteria with respect to proposed technology and indications\r\n\r\nF. Milestones\r\n\r\nBecause device development is an inherently risky process, it is anticipated that there may be attrition as projects progress. Applications must propose one or more milestones for each objective in each year of the project. Milestones are goals that quantitatively measure success and efficacy that will be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project (see below for details).\r\n\r\nFor each objective, provide details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data and statistical analysis plans. Specify the quantitative criteria for measuring success and the rationale used to develop and justify the criteria identified. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art in the field. Applicants are encouraged to read examples of milestones (e.g., https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Apply-Funding/Application-Support-Library/Devices-Milestones).\r\n\r\nNIH program staff will contact the applicant to discuss the project and any changes prior to funding the application, including negotiation of the proposed milestones.  The final agreed upon and approved milestones will be specified in the Notice of Award (NoA). Progress towards achievement of the final set of milestones will be evaluated yearly by NIH program staff. Program staff may involve independent consultants or subject matter experts with relevant expertise. If justified, future milestones may be revised based on data and information obtained during the previous project period. If, based on the progress report, a funded project does not meet the milestones, funding for the project will be discontinued. In addition to milestones, the decision to continue funding will also be based on: a robust data package that allows for adequate interpretation of results (regardless of whether they have been captured in the milestones), overall progress, portfolio balance and program priorities, competitive landscape, and availability of funds.\r\n\r\nNIH encourages rigor and reproducibility of observed results. In some cases, conducting additional critical experiments will be important for NIH to have confidence in making a funding decision.\r\n\r\nSBIR Phase I to Phase II transition:\r\n\r\nAn administrative review will be conducted by program staff, with potential input by independent consultants, to decide whether the Phase I project will be transitioned to the Phase II project based on the following:\r\n\r\nSuccessful achievement of the Phase I milestones;\r\nLikelihood of success in clinical testing;\r\nCompetitive landscape;\r\nProgram priorities and current portfolio balance (for funded projects, search NIH RePORTER https://projectreporter.nih.gov/);\r\nFor significant risk studies, documentation of final or conditional approval of the IDE from the FDA;\r\nIRB approval(s);\r\nSubmission of the final clinical protocol and supporting documents to NIH ;\r\nFeedback on activities involving human subjects obtained from the NIH Safety and Risk Assessment Committee (SARAC);\r\nAgreement on updated timeline, milestones and budget for the clinical study, and\r\nAvailability of funds.\r\nG. Quality and Compliance Requirements\r\n\r\nThe use of the Design Control and Quality Systems processes (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/design-control-guidance-medical-device-manufacturers) to the degree specified by the FDA is required. Intermediate steps in the Design Control process (e.g., design reviews, design verification, design validation, and design transfer activities) where appropriate, and IDE submission should be represented in the annual milestones. NIH recognizes that the degree to which Design Controls and Quality Systems processes are required by the FDA may vary substantially depending on the specific device. Investigators are encouraged to discuss these issues with the FDA and regulatory consultants prior to submitting an application so the extent to which these processes are required is clearly defined and verifiable in the application. Applicants should consider the Quality System requirements at the IDE stage (i.e., design controls) when preparing their device development activities. Applicants should consider Guidelines and Policies for Monitoring Clinical Research in the formation of a plan for data and safety monitoring as required by the appropriate IC.\r\n\r\nI. Pre-application Consultation\r\n\r\nAs an U44 cooperative agreement, NIH program staff will be involved in the negotiation and execution of the project. When possible applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with NIH program staff early in the process of planning an application; this provides the opportunity for the SBC to receive further guidance on program scope, goals, and developing appropriate milestones. Applicants should contact program staff at least 12 weeks before a receipt date.\r\n\r\nJ.

Overview\r\n\r\nRecent advances in biology offer unprecedented opportunities to discover new treatments for nervous system disorders. Biotherapeutic development, however, has inherent complexities with regards to characterization, manufacturing, delivery, and administration. Many academic laboratories and small business enterprises don\u2019t have the full scope of expertise and resources available; this program seeks to bridge those gaps. For instance, all therapeutic candidates including biologics, must obtain the requisite toxicology and safety pharmacology data package and undergo regulatory review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\r\n\r\nThe NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research is a collaborative framework through which 14 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices jointly support neuroscience-related research, with the aim of accelerating discoveries and reducing the burden of nervous system disorders (for further information, see http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/). To facilitate biotherapeutic discovery and development by the neuroscience community, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologics (BPN-Biologics), which includes biotechnology products and biologics-based therapies (e.g., peptides, proteins), gene (e.g., oligonucleotide- and viral-based) and cell therapies, and other novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies). Within this network, neuroscience researchers can utilize funding for discovery and development activities that can be conducted in their own laboratories in collaboration with NIH-funded consultants and optionally also access NIH contracted research organizations (CROs) that specialize in manufacturing, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and Phase I clinical testing. A current list of BPN-Biologics contractors and consultants is available at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-resources.\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications from small business concerns for new BPN Biologics-based therapy projects. Applicants may propose to conduct all experimental activities in their own labs or collaborate with BPN-Biologics CROs on activities of their choice. A Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) with some, but not all, required expertise and resources may request funding to conduct studies in his or her own lab and collaborate with BPN-Biologics CROs on any remaining studies. By contrast, a PD/PI with limited experience in biologics development may opt to collaborate with all available BPN-Biologics CROs. Regardless, the Program PD/PI will be responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools.\r\n\r\nFor each project funded under this FOA, the NIH will assemble a customized Lead Development Team (LDT). The LDT will be co-chaired by the PD/PI and a BPN-Biologics consultant and will include members of the PD/PI's team, additional BPN-Biologics consultants, and NIH staff. Projects are funded via a U44 Fast-Track cooperative agreement mechanism that is milestone-driven and involves the LDT\u2019s participation in establishing the project plan, monitoring research progress, and setting appropriate go/no-go decision-making criteria. The LDT will develop an overall strategy for the project, including milestone proposals, plan studies to be conducted by BPN-Biologics contractors, and coordinate activities across different research sites. Progression from the U44 Phase I award to the U44 Phase II award will be based on administrative review and availability of funds (see Section D, Milestones).\r\n\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to read Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the BPN-Biologics website (https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-frequently-asked-questions) and contact NIH Scientific/Research staff and participating NIH Institutes/Centers prior to preparing an application to discuss how they may best utilize BPN-Biologics resources and whether their application fits the mission of a particular NIH IC.\r\n\r\nFor this FOA, Phase I clinical testing, studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. U44 Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.\r\n\r\nB. Scope\r\n\r\nBPN-Biologics is dedicated to the translation of biological therapeutics towards clinical testing by supporting the discovery and development of novel and promising biotherapeutic candidates for neurological diseases. This FOA is not designed to support discovery and development of small molecules (see Companion BPN Funding Opportunities). Applicants should contact NIH Scientific/Research staff regarding small peptides (less than 6 amino acids), natural products, and/or combination therapies to determine the fit for this FOA as well as suitability for discovery and development within the BPN.\r\n\r\nTo be supported by this FOA, a project must focus on a single nervous system condition that falls within the mission of one of the participating Institutes or Centers. Please see Section C below for more information on the interests of the participating Institutes and Centers and alternative programs to consider.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective is that all projects should reach the clinical trial stage (regardless of entry point) within a maximum of 5 years of BPN-Biologics funding and support. A schematic of this project structure is available on the BPN-Biologics website at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-resources.\r\n\r\nProjects can enter at either:\r\n\r\nThe Discovery stage to optimize a promising lead compound then transition into development with the goal on entering the clinic by the end of no later than the 5th year. Applications that propose entry with a Discovery stage biologic lead should include a Development work plan as well.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nThe Development stage to advance a single biologic candidate through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies, filing an IND package with the FDA, and an optional Phase I clinical trial.\r\n\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIH Scientific/Research staff prior to preparing an application. The following sections describe the Discovery and Development stages in more detail.\r\n\r\nGeneral Entry Criteria:\r\n\r\nAll projects must meet the following entry requirements:\r\n\r\nIdentified one or more lead biologic agent(s) sufficiently profiled so that the parameters still to be optimized can be quantitatively specified.\r\nEstablished preliminary in vivo efficacy and target engagement data using agent(s) in relevant animal model(s). The agent(s) should show in vivo efficacy using clinically relevant outcome measures (e.g., biochemical, anatomical and/or functional, when possible) and in vivo target engagement (e.g., measurement of target binding or proximal downstream effects) at the clinically intended site of action, using sufficient experimental and statistical rigor in a relevant animal in vivo proof-of-concept model. Applications may be considered without an in vivo/ex vivo efficacy requirement if there is a clear rationale backed-up with compelling in vitro data.\r\nDemonstrated that the key in vitro and in vivo assays are suitable to drive the characterization and optimization of lead biologics in a rigorous fashion and are available in either the applicant\u2019s or collaborator\u2019s laboratories.\r\nThe proposed approach is unlikely to be blocked by any legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints to pursuing the proposed agent(s) and using the proposed assays and models for research purposes and/or commercial development.\r\nDiscovery Stage\r\n\r\nProjects that require lead characterization and optimization to improve the potency and/or suitability for clinical testing will enter the BPN-Biologics at the Discovery stage. The BPN-Biologics supports a maximum of two years of lead optimization. Therefore, by the end of the U44 Phase I, the PD/PI should have identified a clinical candidate that meets the entry criteria for the Development stage (U44 Phase II).\r\n\r\nExamples of activities that can be supported during the Discovery (U44 Phase I) stage include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nCharacterization of identity and properties (e.g., cell phenotype, aggregation, epitope mapping, glycosylation or other post-translational modification, number of unpaired cysteines, oxidation, deamination, isomerization, proteolytic sites, sequences, viscosity, stability)\r\nOptimization and/or qualification of appropriate assays for pharmacokinetic, target engagement markers, biodistribution, or other assays to monitor safety available to be used in the U44 Phase II\r\nDetermination of optimal route of administration\r\nLead optimization to improve effectiveness, diminish toxicity, and increase absorption (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME))\r\nDemonstration of adequate/stage-appropriate preliminary safety, such as safety pharmacology and/or dose-range finding toxicology\r\nInitial development of pharmacodynamic biomarker assay(s)\r\nThe goal at the end of the Discovery stage is to select a clinical candidate with appropriate bioactivity, stability, manufacturability, and bioavailability by the intended route of administration for development. Other requirements include target engagement with defined minimal and optimal doses by the intended route of administration, other favorable properties consistent with the desired clinical application, and in vivo efficacy when applicable. Projects with only in vitro data need compelling data and rationale that the in vivo studies are not necessary or appropriate. Projects that meet this goal will enter Development in the U44 Phase II award, beginning with the preparatory activities listed below.\r\n\r\nDevelopment Stage\r\n\r\nThe Development stage includes all IND-enabling studies, cGMP synthesis of clinical trial material, and Phase I clinical testing. Applications for entry into the Development stage must have identified the candidate therapeutic.\r\n\r\nEntry Criteria for the development Stage:\r\n\r\nA strong body of data linking the putative therapeutic target to the proposed disease indication and supporting the hypothesis that altering the target activity will produce desirable outcomes for the disease is required.\r\nThe proposed therapeutic should have rationally laid out biological activity by the planned route of administration with exposure levels for activity being achievable based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties appropriate for the intended clinical use.\r\nDemonstration that the ability of the PD/PI's institution to develop and commercialize the proposed biologic is unlikely to be blocked or impeded by legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints and that there is support from the institution to file and maintain the patents estate and necessary regulatory documents along with associated cost (see Other Attachments in Section IV).\r\nAll applications proposing to enter at the Development stage will begin with a U44 Phase I award of up to two years, to prepare for the IND-enabling studies supported during the U44 Phase II award. Projects that began at the Discovery stage will conduct all Development stage preparatory and IND-enabling studies during their U44 Phase II.\r\n\r\nDevelopment stage U44 Phase I activities can include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny remaining optimization activities as listed above, if needed\r\nNon-GLP toxicology studies (e.g., dose-range finding toxicology)\r\nFormulation\r\nScale up manufacture\r\nReplication of in vivo studies in the same or a different animal model\r\nA pre-IND meeting with FDA, if not already conducted\r\nThe following are general expectations for a project to initiate Development IND-enabling studies within BPN-Biologics:\r\n\r\nDose-range finding (DRF) toxicology studies (rodent and non-rodent) have shown an acceptable safety margin\r\nManufacturing-related development processes, including compound assay release criteria (e.g. potency and stability indicating) have been established\r\nOptimal delivery route has been determined\r\nDevelopment Activities for the U44 Phase II award may include the following:\r\n\r\ncGMP manufacturing of material for IND-enabling and/or Phase I clinical testing\r\nIND-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies to determine a basis for clinical dose extrapolation using a relevant animal model\r\nIND document preparation and filing with the FDA\r\nPhase I clinical trial (a single and/or multiple ascending dose study to characterize safety, PK, and PD) (See below for more information regarding clinical trials\r\nThe goal by the end of the Development stage is to begin a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial.\r\n\r\nNote: Key studies should be sufficiently powered and controlled with experimental and statistical rigor to lend a high degree of confidence in the results, with detailed information available about study design, execution, analysis, and interpretation.\r\n\r\nBPN-Biologics contractors can conduct the preclinical safety studies, cGMP manufacturing, formulation and other activities required to prepare for human testing. BPN-Biologics contractors will provide data and reports in a format suitable for inclusion in an IND application and will assist in the development of the application. The Phase I clinical trial can also be conducted through BPN-Biologics contractors.\r\n\r\nThe PD/PI's Institution will be responsible for assembly and submission of the IND application and scheduling regulatory meetings with the FDA, and therefore, should include support for this activity in their plan. NIH staff and consultants on the LDT must be included in all meetings with the FDA.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information regarding Clinical Trials\r\n\r\nApplicants are strongly advised to discuss plans with NIH program staff prior to submitting their application to determine whether a clinical trial is feasible within the proposed funding timeframe and/or available BPN-Biologics contract resources. In the event that only diseased patients are expected to be enrolled, the applicants\u2019 own clinical site(s) must be proposed.\r\n\r\nClinical Trial Design: Single dose or single ascending dose treatment which may be placebo-controlled or open-label studies; multiple ascending dose may be requested only if agent has a short half-life. Clinical trial outcomes may include safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, target engagement and target modulation endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe development of the protocol and management of the Phase I trial will be performed by a Clinical Development Team (CDT), which will evolve from the LDT and include the PD/PI, clinical consultants identified by the PD/PI, and NIH staff. The protocol-selected supporting trial documents, and regulatory documents will be submitted to NIH for administrative review (including internal and external experts) prior to commencement of the clinical trial (defined as signing of first informed consent).\r\n\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this FOA\r\n\r\nNon-responsive applications include those that involve any of the following activities:\r\n\r\nBasic research and studies of disease mechanism\r\nAnimal model development\r\nEarly discovery research, such as identifying and validating targets and generation of preliminary agents that are not suitable for human testing\r\nDevelopment of small molecule compounds (covered by PAR-20-122 and PAR-20-111)\r\nDevelopment of diagnostics and medical devices\r\nDevelopment of risk, detection, diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and prevention biomarkers as well as PET ligands\r\nStand-alone clinical trials\r\nStudies directed beyond first-in-human Phase I clinical testing\r\nNon-responsive applications will not be reviewed.\r\n \r\n\r\nC. NIH Institute and Center Interests and Guidance\r\n\r\nNational Institute on Aging (NIA)\r\n\r\nNIA is interested in projects that will provide drug development expertise and infrastructure support to researchers interested in developing new biologics aimed at modifying the behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), delaying the onset or slowing the progression of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), other dementias of aging and age-related cognitive decline. Researchers who may have the necessary drug development expertise and access to infrastructure to advance small molecules to the clinic should consider submitting an application to the Alzheimer's Drug Development Program (PAR-18-820). Regarding therapeutic approaches, NIA is interested in traditional biotherapeutic modalities such as gene and immunotherapies and other modalities such as genome editing, gene silencing, and PROTAC. NIA and the AD scientific community recognize that one of the major challenges to the successful development of drugs for AD is the poor translation of preclinical efficacy from AD animal models to the clinic. Meta analyses of preclinical studies indicate that a key factor contributing to the poor predictive power of AD animal models is the lack of standards in the design, conduct, and data analyses. Therefore, to improve the quality and predictive value of animal model studies NIA urges applicants to follow best practices guidelines as summarized at: https://grants.nih.gov/reproducibility/module_1/presentation_html5.html.\r\n\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\r\n\r\nWithout a specific \"receptor\", alcohol has numerous molecular targets in the brain, and alcohol-seeking behavior and alcoholism are influenced by multiple neurotransmitter systems, neuromodulators, hormones, and signal transduction pathways. Many potential target sites for which new pharmaceuticals may be developed have, therefore, been identified. These include neurotransmitter systems related to opioids, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), endocannabinoids, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, adenosine, neuropeptide systems (for example, neuropeptide Y, corticotropin releasing factor), signal transduction pathways (such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C); and gene transcription factors (such as delta Fos B and cAMP response element-binding protein [CREB]). NIAAA is interested in research aimed to develop pharmaceuticals targeting new molecular sites to provide effective therapy to a broader spectrum of alcoholic individuals. Recent research has discovered specific genetic variants that may contribute to the risk for alcoholism and/or render alcohol dependent individuals responsive to specific therapeutic agent. NIAAA is interested in supporting research to develop pharmaceuticals targeting individuals with identified genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to improve efficacy and safety.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. Diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. Fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. It is expected that the Alcohol Research Centers will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per NOT OD 20-031 (Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity). NIAAA is especially interested in enhancing representation from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.\r\n\r\nNational Eye Institute (NEI)\r\n\r\nThe National Eye Institute (NEI) interest in BPN-Biologics is to develop novel therapies to treat diseases and disorders of the visual system, especially blinding eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and other conditions. The NEI is also interested in other visual system disorders such as strabismus and amblyopia that could be treated with biologics-based interventions. Each project should have a well-defined endpoint, achievable within a five-year time frame, for developing a treatment for a specific disease or disorder of the visual system. The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a novel therapeutic that can then be tested in a clinical trial. If successful, a project funded under this program may lead to filing an IND-directed toxicological study, and Phase I clinical testing. Investigators are encouraged to contact NEI program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the Institute.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)\r\n\r\nNIDCR is interested in BPN Biologics development for craniofacial disorders and painful disorders of the orofacial region including temporomandibular joint disorders, trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, oral cancer pain, dental pain and other conditions. Recent advances in genomics and phenotyping of subjects with orofacial pain conditions have expanded the scope of potential targets to treat these conditions. Receptor systems, ion channels, and pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules have been implicated in chronic pain. NIDCR is interested in supporting research that will lead to highly efficacious and specific pharmacological treatments of subjects with orofacial pain disorders.\r\n\r\nAwardees will be required to comply with the NIDCR Clinical Terms of Award for activities that involve human subjects research that have been determined by NIDCR to need additional oversight. Investigators are encouraged to contact NIDCR program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the Institute mission and strategic plan.\r\n\r\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)\r\n\r\nThe NICHD is interested in supporting research aimed to develop novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of developmental disorders, diseases and conditions in pediatric population. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with NICHD Scientific/Research contact prior to submitting their application.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\r\n\r\nNIMH supports neuroscience research to discover the causes of mental illness and to develop more effective and safe treatments. NIMH has interest in applications proposing the development of biologics as an approach for the treatment of mental disorders, including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, and autism spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\nResearchers with expertise and interest in advancing small molecules to the clinics should consider submitting an application to the BPN-small molecules Program (PAR-20-111 and PAR-20-122), small molecules projects at the early clinical trials phase should consider the NIMH SBIR/STTR Programs or the First in Human and Early Stage Clinical Trials of Novel Investigational Drugs or Devices for Psychiatric Disorders (U01) PAR-18-427. Investigators interested in the development of small molecule projects are also encouraged to review the following NIMH drug discovery FOAs: Drug Discovery for Nervous System Disorders PAR-19-147 (R01) and PAR-19-146 (R21), Assay development and screening for discovery of chemical probes or therapeutic agents PAR-20-271 (R01), Discovery of in vivo Chemical Probes for Novel Brain Targets PAR-21-029 (R01), Discovery of Cell-based Chemical Probes for Novel Brain Targets PAR-21-028 (R21), National Cooperative Drug Discovery/Development Groups (NCDDG) for the Treatment of Mental Disorders, Drug or Alcohol Addiction PAR-20-118 (U01) and PAR-20-119 (U19).\r\n\r\nFor this initiative, NIMH will only support projects entering the BPN-Biologics at the Discovery stage for monogenetic severe neurodevelopmental health disorders (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorders). NIMH will not support projects entering the BPN-Biologics at the Development (IND enabling/GMP synthesis or Phase I trials) stage. NIMH is interested in gene-based therapies such as genome-editing modalities and viral gene deliveries. NIMH is not interested in therapies based on large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides) or oligonucleotides. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with NIMH Scientific/Research contact prior to submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with NIMH priorities and to assess whether this or other NIMH funding opportunities are most appropriate.\r\n\r\nConsistent with NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than DSM diagnostic entities are encouraged. Additional information about the RDoC approach can be found at the RDoC website.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality and reproducible studies that are reported to the scientific community in a transparent manner are an essential cornerstone of the research enterprise. Attention to principles of study design and transparency are essential to enable reviewers, the scientific community, and NIH to assess the quality of scientific findings. In support of this important goal, investigators must follow instructions to address Rigor and Reproducibility (http://grants.nih.gov/reproducibility/index.htm)\r\n\r\nNIMH has published a Note with guidelines and priorities for potential applicants considering animal neurobehavioral approaches in research relevant to mental illnesses, investigators are strongly to follow the guidelines summarized at NOT-MH-19-053 if proposing to include behavioral measures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on NIMH research priorities can be found in the NIMH Strategic Research Plan and Interventions Workgroup Report. Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss applications with NIMH staff listed in Section VII - Agency Contact(s)Scientific/Research Contacts.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorder sand Stroke (NINDS)\r\n\r\nExamples of diseases relevant to the research mission of the NINDS can be found at https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders. Applicants are encouraged to contact the NINDS to discuss disease areas of interest as this list is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\nThis FOA serves as the primary support mechanism at NINDS for the optimization and development biologics and biotechnology products. Applicants seeking support for early drug discovery research are encouraged to review NINDS SBIR/STTR programs. Applicants seeking support only to conduct early stage clinical trials should consider applying for an NINDS Exploratory Clinical Trial, through PAR-18-618 (or its reissue), which provides additional flexibility in budget and time, as well as the option of including a phase II trial.\r\n\r\nThe quality and reproducibility of both preclinical and clinical research depend on the rigor with which researchers conduct studies, control for potential bias, and report essential methodological details. Examples of critical elements of a well-designed study are summarized on the NINDS website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/transparency_in_reporting_guidance.pdf. NINDS urges applicants to this program to consider these elements when describing supporting data and proposed studies.\r\n\r\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)\r\n\r\nNCCIH is interested in supporting research on development of novel biologics from natural products (e.g., venoms and conotoxins) and microbial and microbiome therapies to modulate symptoms on nervous system disorders including pain, sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, mild depression, and stress etc. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with the NCCIH Scientific/Research contact prior to submitting their applications.\r\n\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\r\n\r\nThrough participating in this FOA, NIDA aims to provide drug development expertise and infrastructure to support the addiction researchers interested in developing new biotherapeutics for substance use disorders (SUD). Projects focused on cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana use disorders are of high priority for NIDA because there are currently no FDA-approved treatments for these indications. NIDA will only support projects to develop innovative pharmacological approaches entering the BPN-Biologics at the Discovery stage. Specifically, NIDA is interested in using the BPN-Biologics mechanism to support (academic) addiction researchers in the \"lead optimization\" stages. NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of the opportunities the BPN-Biologics affords, including collaboration with BPN-Biologics consultants and NIH-supported contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and manufacturing. Researchers who possess the drug development expertise and access to the necessary infrastructure to advance biotherapeutics to the clinic, should consider submitting their applications to specialized NIDA-administered programs. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with NIDA program staff prior to submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with NIDA's interest and priorities. NIDA staff will also provide help in assessing whether this or other NIDA funding opportunities would be the most appropriate.\r\n \r\n\r\nD. Milestones\r\n\r\nBecause biotherapeutic discovery and development are inherently high risk, it is expected that there will be attrition as projects progress. Go/No-Go milestones will be established by the NIH with input from the LDTs at the start of each project and updated as needed.\r\n\r\nAn administrative review will be conducted by NIH program staff, with technical input from an External Oversight Committee (composed of senior non-federal scientists who are not directly involved in BPN-Biologics projects), to assess milestone progress and recommend which projects will advance from the U44 Phase I to the Phase II and assess progress after each subsequent milestone based on:\r\n\r\nSuccessful achievement of milestones\r\nThe overall feasibility of project advancement, considering data that may not have been captured in milestones\r\nCompetitive landscape for the disease indication and biotherapeutic target\r\nProgram priorities\r\nAvailability of funds\r\nNote: If a funded project does not make satisfactory progress toward the agreed upon milestones at any stage during the funding period, access to BPN-Biologics contract resources and future year grant funding may be discontinued (see Section VI.2).\r\n\r\nApproval for commencement of a clinical trial (defined as signing of informed consent by first prospective subject) will include the following:\r\n\r\nSuccessful achievement of the defined preclinical development milestones;\r\nSubmission of an IND with documentation for one of the following: 1) acceptance of clinical protocol by FDA; 2) elapse of the 30-day post filing waiting period without comment from the FDA; 3) completion of protocol changes or amendments requested by FDA.\r\nSubmission of the clinical protocol and supporting documents to NIH for administrative review and notification of NIH approval;\r\nAgreement on updated timeline and milestones for the clinical trial.\r\nE. Quality and Compliance Requirements\r\n\r\nSince the goal of this program is to generate therapeutics which will be eligible for FDA approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that all IND enabling nonclinical studies will be performed in a manner consistent with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and current FDA guidance.\r\nAll clinical trials must be performed following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in accord with NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring.\r\nInvestigational products for use in clinical trials must be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) practices.\r\n \r\n\r\nF. Intellectual Property (IP)\r\n\r\nSince the ultimate goal of this program is to bring new biotherapeutics to the market, the creation and protection of intellectual property (IP) that will make biologic drug candidates attractive to potential licensing and commercialization partners are a significant consideration in designing research strategies and prioritizing projects for funding. This program is structured so that the awardee institution retains their assignment of IP rights and gains assignment of IP rights from the BPN-Biologics contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for biologic drug candidates developed in this program. It is expected that the awardee institution will take responsibility for patent filings, maintenance and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization. The PD/PI is expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at his or her institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. Award recipients will be encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of the BPN-Biologics.","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2142413","subtopics":[]}]},{"solicitation_title":"PHS 2023-2 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH for Small Business Technology Transfer Grant Applications (Parent STTR [R41/R42] Clinical Trial Required)","solicitation_number":"PA-23-233","program":"STTR","phase":"BOTH","agency":"Department of Health and Human Services","branch":"National Institutes of Health","solicitation_year":"2023","release_date":"2023-07-12","open_date":"2023-08-05","close_date":"2024-04-06","application_due_date":["2023-09-05","2024-01-05","2024-04-05"],"occurrence_number":null,"sbir_solicitation_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2443063","solicitation_agency_url":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/PA-files/PA-23-233.html","current_status":"open","solicitation_topics":[{"topic_title":"PHS 2023-2 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH for Small Business Technology Transfer Grant Applications (Parent STTR [R41/R42] Clinical Trial Required)","branch":"National Institutes of Health","topic_number":"PA-23-233","topic_description":"The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, also known as America's Seed Fund, are one of the largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization in the United States.

Small business applicants interested in submitting an SBIR grant application should submit to PA-23-230 or PA-23-231. \r\n\r\nSBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project.

These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFOor other specific NOFOs, are listed in the PHS 2023-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA.

These programs enable US-owned and operated small businesses to conduct research and development that has a strong potential for commercialization. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.\r\n\r\nThe SBIR program, as established by law and reauthorized under Public Law 114-328, Section 1834, Public Law 115-232, and Public Law 117-183, is intended to meet the following goals: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increase the private sector commercialization of innovations developed through federal research and development funding; and foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by women and socially or economically disadvantaged persons.\r\n\r\nThe STTR program aims to foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their extramural research budget to the SBIR program, and those with extramural research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside an additional 0.45% to the STTR program.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. See Notice of NIH\u2019s Interest in Diversity, NOT-OD-20-031. Fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses in technological innovation is one of the goals of the SBIR and STTR programs (https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/SBA_SBIR_STTR_POLICY_DIRECTIVE_OCT_2020_v2.pdf).\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThis Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-23-232or PA-23-233. \r\n\r\nSBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.\r\n\r\nNIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.\r\n\r\nNIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH will accept Direct to Phase II applications regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Direct to Phase II awards should be submitted as \u201cNew\u201d applications and not continuations (\"Renewal\") of Phase I SBIR or STTR projects.\r\n\r\nNIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR or STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFOs or other specific NOFOs, are listed in the current PHS 2023-2 SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA.

Overview\r\n\r\nRecent advances in biology offer unprecedented opportunities to discover new treatments for nervous system disorders. Biotherapeutic development, however, has inherent complexities with regards to characterization, manufacturing, delivery, and administration. Many academic laboratories and small business enterprises don\u2019t have the full scope of expertise and resources available; this program seeks to bridge those gaps. For instance, all therapeutic candidates including biologics, must obtain the requisite toxicology and safety pharmacology data package and undergo regulatory review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\r\n\r\nThe NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research is a collaborative framework through which 14 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices jointly support neuroscience-related research, with the aim of accelerating discoveries and reducing the burden of nervous system disorders (for further information, see http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/). To facilitate biotherapeutic discovery and development by the neuroscience community, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologics (BPN-Biologics), which includes biotechnology products and biologics-based therapies (e.g., peptides, proteins), gene (e.g., oligonucleotide- and viral-based) and cell therapies, and other novel emerging therapies (e.g., microbial and microbiome therapies). Within this network, neuroscience researchers can utilize funding for discovery and development activities that can be conducted in their own laboratories in collaboration with NIH-funded consultants and optionally also access NIH contracted research organizations (CROs) that specialize in manufacturing, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and Phase I clinical testing. A current list of BPN-Biologics contractors and consultants is available at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics/resources.\r\n\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications from small business concerns for new BPN Biologics-based therapy projects. Applicants may propose to conduct all experimental activities in their own labs or collaborate with BPN-Biologics CROs on activities of their choice. A Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) with some, but not all, required expertise and resources may request funding to conduct studies in his or her own lab and collaborate with BPN-Biologics CROs on any remaining studies. By contrast, a PD/PI with limited experience in biologics development may opt to collaborate with all available BPN-Biologics CROs. Regardless, the Program PD/PI will be responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools.\r\n\r\nFor each project funded under this FOA, the NIH will assemble a customized Lead Development Team (LDT). The LDT will be co-chaired by the PD/PI and a BPN-Biologics consultant and will include members of the PD/PI's team, additional BPN-Biologics consultants, and NIH staff. Projects are funded via a U44 Fast-Track cooperative agreement mechanism that is milestone-driven and involves the LDT\u2019s participation in establishing the project plan, monitoring research progress, and setting appropriate go/no-go decision-making criteria. The LDT will develop an overall strategy for the project, including milestone proposals, plan studies to be conducted by BPN-Biologics contractors, and coordinate activities across different research sites. Progression from the U44 Phase I award to the U44 Phase II award will be based on administrative review and availability of funds (see Section D, Milestones).\r\n\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to read Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the BPN-Biologics website (https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics/faqs) and contact NIH Scientific/Research staff and participating NIH Institutes/Centers prior to preparing an application to discuss how they may best utilize BPN-Biologics resources and whether their application fits the mission of a particular NIH IC.\r\n\r\nFor this FOA, Phase I clinical testing, studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. U44 Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.\r\n\r\nB. Scope\r\n\r\nBPN-Biologics is dedicated to the translation of biological therapeutics towards clinical testing by supporting the discovery and development of novel and promising biotherapeutic candidates for neurological diseases. This FOA is not designed to support discovery and development of small molecules (see Companion BPN Funding Opportunities). Applicants should contact NIH Scientific/Research staff regarding small peptides (less than 6 amino acids), natural products, and/or combination therapies to determine the fit for this FOA as well as suitability for discovery and development within the BPN.\r\n\r\nTo be supported by this FOA, a project must focus on a single nervous system condition that falls within the mission of one of the participating Institutes or Centers. Please see Section C below for more information on the interests of the participating Institutes and Centers and alternative programs to consider.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective is that all projects should reach the clinical trial stage (regardless of entry point) within a maximum of 5 years of BPN-Biologics funding and support. A schematic of this project structure is available on the BPN-Biologics website at: https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/neurotherapeutics/bpn-biologics/resources.\r\n\r\nProjects can enter at either:\r\n\r\nThe Discovery stage to optimize a promising lead compound then transition into development with the goal on entering the clinic by the end of no later than the 5th year. Applications that propose entry with a Discovery stage biologic lead should include a Development work plan as well.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nThe Development stage to advance a single biologic candidate through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies, filing an IND package with the FDA, and an optional Phase I clinical trial.\r\n\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to contact NIH Scientific/Research staff prior to preparing an application. The following sections describe the Discovery and Development stages in more detail.\r\n\r\nGeneral Entry Criteria:\r\n\r\nAll projects must meet the following entry requirements:\r\n\r\nIdentified one or more lead biologic agent(s) sufficiently profiled so that the parameters still to be optimized can be quantitatively specified.\r\nEstablished preliminary in vivo efficacy and target engagement data using agent(s) in relevant animal model(s). The agent(s) should show in vivo efficacy using clinically relevant outcome measures (e.g., biochemical, anatomical and/or functional, when possible) and in vivo target engagement (e.g., measurement of target binding or proximal downstream effects) at the clinically intended site of action, using sufficient experimental and statistical rigor in a relevant animal in vivo proof-of-concept model. Applications may be considered without an in vivo/ex vivo efficacy requirement if there is a clear rationale backed-up with compelling in vitro data.\r\nDemonstrated that the key in vitro and in vivo assays are suitable to drive the characterization and optimization of lead biologics in a rigorous fashion and are available in either the applicant\u2019s or collaborator\u2019s laboratories.\r\nThe proposed approach is unlikely to be blocked by any legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints to pursuing the proposed agent(s) and using the proposed assays and models for research purposes and/or commercial development.\r\nDiscovery Stage\r\n\r\nProjects that require lead characterization and optimization to improve the potency and/or suitability for clinical testing will enter the BPN-Biologics at the Discovery stage. The BPN-Biologics supports a maximum of two years of lead optimization. Therefore, by the end of the U44 Phase I, the PD/PI should have identified a clinical candidate that meets the entry criteria for the Development stage (U44 Phase II).\r\n\r\nExamples of activities that can be supported during the Discovery (U44 Phase I) stage include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nCharacterization of identity and properties (e.g., cell phenotype, aggregation, epitope mapping, glycosylation or other post-translational modification, number of unpaired cysteines, oxidation, deamination, isomerization, proteolytic sites, sequences, viscosity, stability)\r\nOptimization and/or qualification of appropriate assays for pharmacokinetic, target engagement markers, biodistribution, or other assays to monitor safety available to be used in the U44 Phase II\r\nDetermination of optimal route of administration\r\nLead optimization to improve effectiveness, diminish toxicity, and increase absorption (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME))\r\nDemonstration of adequate/stage-appropriate preliminary safety, such as safety pharmacology and/or dose-range finding toxicology\r\nInitial development of pharmacodynamic biomarker assay(s)\r\nThe goal at the end of the Discovery stage is to select a clinical candidate with appropriate bioactivity, stability, manufacturability, and bioavailability by the intended route of administration for development. Other requirements include target engagement with defined minimal and optimal doses by the intended route of administration, other favorable properties consistent with the desired clinical application, and in vivo efficacy when applicable. Projects with only in vitro data need compelling data and rationale that the in vivo studies are not necessary or appropriate. Projects that meet this goal will enter Development in the U44 Phase II award, beginning with the preparatory activities listed below.\r\n\r\nDevelopment Stage\r\n\r\nThe Development stage includes all IND-enabling studies, cGMP synthesis of clinical trial material, and Phase I clinical testing. Applications for entry into the Development stage must have identified the candidate therapeutic.\r\n\r\nEntry Criteria for the development Stage:\r\n\r\nA strong body of data linking the putative therapeutic target to the proposed disease indication and supporting the hypothesis that altering the target activity will produce desirable outcomes for the disease is required.\r\nThe proposed therapeutic should have rationally laid out biological activity by the planned route of administration with exposure levels for activity being achievable based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties appropriate for the intended clinical use.\r\nDemonstration that the ability of the PD/PI's institution to develop and commercialize the proposed biologic is unlikely to be blocked or impeded by legal (e.g., intellectual property) constraints and that there is support from the institution to file and maintain the patents estate and necessary regulatory documents along with associated cost (see Other Attachments in Section IV).\r\nAll applications proposing to enter at the Development stage will begin with a U44 Phase I award of up to two years, to prepare for the IND-enabling studies supported during the U44 Phase II award. Projects that began at the Discovery stage will conduct all Development stage preparatory and IND-enabling studies during their U44 Phase II.\r\n\r\nDevelopment stage U44 Phase I activities can include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nAny remaining optimization activities as listed above, if needed\r\nNon-GLP toxicology studies (e.g., dose-range finding toxicology)\r\nFormulation\r\nScale up manufacture\r\nReplication of in vivo studies in the same or a different animal model\r\nA pre-IND meeting with FDA, if not already conducted\r\nThe following are general expectations for a project to initiate Development IND-enabling studies within BPN-Biologics:\r\n\r\nDose-range finding (DRF) toxicology studies (rodent and non-rodent) have shown an acceptable safety margin\r\nManufacturing-related development processes, including compound assay release criteria (e.g. potency and stability indicating) have been established\r\nOptimal delivery route has been determined\r\nDevelopment Activities for the U44 Phase II award may include the following:\r\n\r\ncGMP manufacturing of material for IND-enabling and/or Phase I clinical testing\r\nIND-enabling safety pharmacology and toxicology studies to determine a basis for clinical dose extrapolation using a relevant animal model\r\nIND document preparation and filing with the FDA\r\nPhase I clinical trial (a single and/or multiple ascending dose study to characterize safety, PK, and PD) (See below for more information regarding clinical trials\r\nThe goal by the end of the Development stage is to begin a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial.\r\n\r\nNote: Key studies should be sufficiently powered and controlled with experimental and statistical rigor to lend a high degree of confidence in the results, with detailed information available about study design, execution, analysis, and interpretation.\r\n\r\nBPN-Biologics contractors can conduct the preclinical safety studies, cGMP manufacturing, formulation and other activities required to prepare for human testing. BPN-Biologics contractors will provide data and reports in a format suitable for inclusion in an IND application and will assist in the development of the application. The Phase I clinical trial can also be conducted through BPN-Biologics contractors.\r\n\r\nThe PD/PI's Institution will be responsible for assembly and submission of the IND application and scheduling regulatory meetings with the FDA, and therefore, should include support for this activity in their plan. NIH staff and consultants on the LDT must be included in all meetings with the FDA.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information regarding Clinical Trials\r\n\r\nApplicants are strongly advised to discuss plans with NIH program staff prior to submitting their application to determine whether a clinical trial is feasible within the proposed funding timeframe and/or available BPN-Biologics contract resources. In the event that only diseased patients are expected to be enrolled, the applicants\u2019 own clinical site(s) must be proposed.\r\n\r\nClinical Trial Design: Single dose or single ascending dose treatment which may be placebo-controlled or open-label studies; multiple ascending dose may be requested only if agent has a short half-life. Clinical trial outcomes may include safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, target engagement and target modulation endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe development of the protocol and management of the Phase I trial will be performed by a Clinical Development Team (CDT), which will evolve from the LDT and include the PD/PI, clinical consultants identified by the PD/PI, and NIH staff. The protocol-selected supporting trial documents, and regulatory documents will be submitted to NIH for administrative review (including internal and external experts) prior to commencement of the clinical trial (defined as signing of first informed consent).\r\n\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this FOA\r\n\r\nNon-responsive applications include those that involve any of the following activities:\r\n\r\nBasic research and studies of disease mechanism\r\nAnimal model development\r\nEarly discovery research, such as identifying and validating targets and generation of preliminary agents that are not suitable for human testing\r\nDevelopment of small molecule compounds (covered by PAR-20-122 and PAR-20-111)\r\nDevelopment of diagnostics and medical devices\r\nDevelopment of risk, detection, diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and prevention biomarkers as well as PET ligands\r\nStand-alone clinical trials\r\nStudies directed beyond first-in-human Phase I clinical testing\r\nNon-responsive applications will not be reviewed.\r\n \r\n\r\nC. NIH Institute and Center Interests and Guidance\r\n\r\nNational Institute on Aging (NIA)\r\n\r\nNIA is interested in projects that will provide drug development expertise and infrastructure support to researchers interested in developing new biologics aimed at modifying the behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), delaying the onset or slowing the progression of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), other dementias of aging and age-related cognitive decline. Researchers who may have the necessary drug development expertise and access to infrastructure to advance small molecules to the clinic should consider submitting an application to the Alzheimer's Drug Development Program (PAR-18-820). Regarding therapeutic approaches, NIA is interested in traditional biotherapeutic modalities such as gene and immunotherapies and other modalities such as genome editing, gene silencing, and PROTAC. NIA and the AD scientific community recognize that one of the major challenges to the successful development of drugs for AD is the poor translation of preclinical efficacy from AD animal models to the clinic. Meta analyses of preclinical studies indicate that a key factor contributing to the poor predictive power of AD animal models is the lack of standards in the design, conduct, and data analyses. Therefore, to improve the quality and predictive value of animal model studies NIA urges applicants to follow best practices guidelines as summarized at: https://grants.nih.gov/reproducibility/module_1/presentation_html5.html.\r\n\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\r\n\r\nWithout a specific \"receptor\", alcohol has numerous molecular targets in the brain, and alcohol-seeking behavior and alcoholism are influenced by multiple neurotransmitter systems, neuromodulators, hormones, and signal transduction pathways. Many potential target sites for which new pharmaceuticals may be developed have, therefore, been identified. These include neurotransmitter systems related to opioids, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), endocannabinoids, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, adenosine, neuropeptide systems (for example, neuropeptide Y, corticotropin releasing factor), signal transduction pathways (such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C); and gene transcription factors (such as delta Fos B and cAMP response element-binding protein [CREB]). NIAAA is interested in research aimed to develop pharmaceuticals targeting new molecular sites to provide effective therapy to a broader spectrum of alcoholic individuals. Recent research has discovered specific genetic variants that may contribute to the risk for alcoholism and/or render alcohol dependent individuals responsive to specific therapeutic agent. NIAAA is interested in supporting research to develop pharmaceuticals targeting individuals with identified genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to improve efficacy and safety.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that diverse teams working together outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and with different life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. Diverse teams of scientists will lead the way to develop more innovative inclusive research that will more broadly enhance public health. Fostering diversity by addressing underrepresentation in the scientific research workforce is a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific workforce. It is expected that the Alcohol Research Centers will include a diverse group of scientists, including individuals from underrepresented backgrounds as per NOT OD 20-031 (Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity). NIAAA is especially interested in enhancing representation from racial, ethnic and gender minorities and early-stage investigators.\r\n\r\nNational Eye Institute (NEI)\r\n\r\nThe National Eye Institute (NEI) interest in BPN-Biologics is to develop novel therapies to treat diseases and disorders of the visual system, especially blinding eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and other conditions. The NEI is also interested in other visual system disorders such as strabismus and amblyopia that could be treated with biologics-based interventions. Each project should have a well-defined endpoint, achievable within a five-year time frame, for developing a treatment for a specific disease or disorder of the visual system. The steps towards this goal should be clearly delineated in a series of milestones that support the development of a novel therapeutic that can then be tested in a clinical trial. If successful, a project funded under this program may lead to filing an IND-directed toxicological study, and Phase I clinical testing. Investigators are encouraged to contact NEI program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the Institute.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)\r\n\r\nNIDCR is interested in BPN Biologics development for craniofacial disorders and painful disorders of the orofacial region including temporomandibular joint disorders, trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, oral cancer pain, dental pain and other conditions. Recent advances in genomics and phenotyping of subjects with orofacial pain conditions have expanded the scope of potential targets to treat these conditions. Receptor systems, ion channels, and pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules have been implicated in chronic pain. NIDCR is interested in supporting research that will lead to highly efficacious and specific pharmacological treatments of subjects with orofacial pain disorders.\r\n\r\nAwardees will be required to comply with the NIDCR Clinical Terms of Award for activities that involve human subjects research that have been determined by NIDCR to need additional oversight. Investigators are encouraged to contact NIDCR program staff to discuss potential research projects prior to application submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with priorities of the Institute mission and strategic plan.\r\n\r\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)\r\n\r\nThe NICHD is interested in supporting research aimed to develop novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of developmental disorders, diseases and conditions in pediatric population. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with NICHD Scientific/Research contact prior to submitting their application.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)\r\n\r\nNIMH supports neuroscience research to discover the causes of mental illness and to develop more effective and safe treatments. NIMH has interest in applications proposing the development of biologics as an approach for the treatment of mental disorders, including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD, and autism spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\nResearchers with expertise and interest in advancing small molecules to the clinics should consider submitting an application to the BPN-small molecules Program (PAR-20-111 and PAR-20-122), small molecules projects at the early clinical trials phase should consider the NIMH SBIR/STTR Programs or the First in Human and Early Stage Clinical Trials of Novel Investigational Drugs or Devices for Psychiatric Disorders (U01) PAR-18-427. Investigators interested in the development of small molecule projects are also encouraged to review the following NIMH drug discovery FOAs: Drug Discovery for Nervous System Disorders PAR-19-147 (R01) and PAR-19-146 (R21), Assay development and screening for discovery of chemical probes or therapeutic agents PAR-20-271 (R01), Discovery of in vivo Chemical Probes for Novel Brain Targets PAR-21-029 (R01), Discovery of Cell-based Chemical Probes for Novel Brain Targets PAR-21-028 (R21), National Cooperative Drug Discovery/Development Groups (NCDDG) for the Treatment of Mental Disorders, Drug or Alcohol Addiction PAR-20-118 (U01) and PAR-20-119 (U19).\r\n\r\nFor this initiative, NIMH will only support projects entering the BPN-Biologics at the Discovery stage for monogenetic severe neurodevelopmental health disorders (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorders). NIMH will not support projects entering the BPN-Biologics at the Development (IND enabling/GMP synthesis or Phase I trials) stage. NIMH is interested in gene-based therapies such as genome-editing modalities and viral gene deliveries. NIMH is not interested in therapies based on large biologic macromolecules, (e.g., proteins, antibodies, and peptides) or oligonucleotides. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with NIMH Scientific/Research contact prior to submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with NIMH priorities and to assess whether this or other NIMH funding opportunities are most appropriate.\r\n\r\nConsistent with NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, research projects directed towards ameliorating pathophysiology that is potentially more proximal to specific functional deficits (domains) than DSM diagnostic entities are encouraged. Additional information about the RDoC approach can be found at the RDoC website.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality and reproducible studies that are reported to the scientific community in a transparent manner are an essential cornerstone of the research enterprise. Attention to principles of study design and transparency are essential to enable reviewers, the scientific community, and NIH to assess the quality of scientific findings. In support of this important goal, investigators must follow instructions to address Rigor and Reproducibility (http://grants.nih.gov/reproducibility/index.htm)\r\n\r\nNIMH has published a Note with guidelines and priorities for potential applicants considering animal neurobehavioral approaches in research relevant to mental illnesses, investigators are strongly to follow the guidelines summarized at NOT-MH-19-053 if proposing to include behavioral measures.\r\n\r\nFurther information on NIMH research priorities can be found in the NIMH Strategic Research Plan and Interventions Workgroup Report. Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss applications with NIMH staff listed in Section VII - Agency Contact(s)Scientific/Research Contacts.\r\n\r\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorder sand Stroke (NINDS)\r\n\r\nExamples of diseases relevant to the research mission of the NINDS can be found at https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders. Applicants are encouraged to contact the NINDS to discuss disease areas of interest as this list is not exhaustive.\r\n\r\nThis FOA serves as the primary support mechanism at NINDS for the optimization and development biologics and biotechnology products. Applicants seeking support for early drug discovery research are encouraged to review NINDS SBIR/STTR programs. Applicants seeking support only to conduct early stage clinical trials should consider applying for an NINDS Exploratory Clinical Trial, through PAR-18-618 (or its reissue), which provides additional flexibility in budget and time, as well as the option of including a phase II trial.\r\n\r\nThe quality and reproducibility of both preclinical and clinical research depend on the rigor with which researchers conduct studies, control for potential bias, and report essential methodological details. Examples of critical elements of a well-designed study are summarized on the NINDS website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/transparency_in_reporting_guidance.pdf. NINDS urges applicants to this program to consider these elements when describing supporting data and proposed studies.\r\n\r\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)\r\n\r\nNCCIH is interested in supporting research on development of novel biologics from natural products (e.g., venoms and conotoxins) and microbial and microbiome therapies to modulate symptoms on nervous system disorders including pain, sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, mild depression, and stress etc. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with the NCCIH Scientific/Research contact prior to submitting their applications.\r\n\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\r\n\r\nThrough participating in this FOA, NIDA aims to provide drug development expertise and infrastructure to support the addiction researchers interested in developing new biotherapeutics for substance use disorders (SUD). Projects focused on cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana use disorders are of high priority for NIDA because there are currently no FDA-approved treatments for these indications. NIDA will only support projects to develop innovative pharmacological approaches entering the BPN-Biologics at the Discovery stage. Specifically, NIDA is interested in using the BPN-Biologics mechanism to support (academic) addiction researchers in the \"lead optimization\" stages. NIDA applicants are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of the opportunities the BPN-Biologics affords, including collaboration with BPN-Biologics consultants and NIH-supported contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and manufacturing. Researchers who possess the drug development expertise and access to the necessary infrastructure to advance biotherapeutics to the clinic, should consider submitting their applications to specialized NIDA-administered programs. Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss their research plans with NIDA program staff prior to submission to determine alignment of the planned studies with NIDA's interest and priorities. NIDA staff will also provide help in assessing whether this or other NIDA funding opportunities would be the most appropriate.\r\n \r\n\r\nD. Milestones\r\n\r\nBecause biotherapeutic discovery and development are inherently high risk, it is expected that there will be attrition as projects progress. Go/No-Go milestones will be established by the NIH with input from the LDTs at the start of each project and updated as needed.\r\n\r\nAn administrative review will be conducted by NIH program staff, with technical input from an External Oversight Committee (composed of senior non-federal scientists who are not directly involved in BPN-Biologics projects), to assess milestone progress and recommend which projects will advance from the U44 Phase I to the Phase II and assess progress after each subsequent milestone based on:\r\n\r\nSuccessful achievement of milestones\r\nThe overall feasibility of project advancement, considering data that may not have been captured in milestones\r\nCompetitive landscape for the disease indication and biotherapeutic target\r\nProgram priorities\r\nAvailability of funds\r\nNote: If a funded project does not make satisfactory progress toward the agreed upon milestones at any stage during the funding period, access to BPN-Biologics contract resources and future year grant funding may be discontinued (see Section VI.2).\r\n\r\nApproval for commencement of a clinical trial (defined as signing of informed consent by first prospective subject) will include the following:\r\n\r\nSuccessful achievement of the defined preclinical development milestones;\r\nSubmission of an IND with documentation for one of the following: 1) acceptance of clinical protocol by FDA; 2) elapse of the 30-day post filing waiting period without comment from the FDA; 3) completion of protocol changes or amendments requested by FDA.\r\nSubmission of the clinical protocol and supporting documents to NIH for administrative review and notification of NIH approval;\r\nAgreement on updated timeline and milestones for the clinical trial.\r\nE. Quality and Compliance Requirements\r\n\r\nSince the goal of this program is to generate therapeutics which will be eligible for FDA approval, adherence to compliance and quality criteria is required.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that all IND enabling nonclinical studies will be performed in a manner consistent with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and current FDA guidance.\r\nAll clinical trials must be performed following Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in accord with NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring.\r\nInvestigational products for use in clinical trials must be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) practices.\r\n \r\n\r\nF. Intellectual Property (IP)\r\n\r\nSince the ultimate goal of this program is to bring new biotherapeutics to the market, the creation and protection of intellectual property (IP) that will make biologic drug candidates attractive to potential licensing and commercialization partners are a significant consideration in designing research strategies and prioritizing projects for funding. This program is structured so that the awardee institution retains their assignment of IP rights and gains assignment of IP rights from the BPN-Biologics contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for biologic drug candidates developed in this program. It is expected that the awardee institution will take responsibility for patent filings, maintenance and licensing efforts toward eventual commercialization. The PD/PI is expected to work closely with technology transfer/business development officials at his or her institution to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project. Award recipients will be encouraged to identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the drug development process, consistent with the goals of the BPN-Biologics.","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/1966203","subtopics":[]}]},{"solicitation_title":"NeuroNEXT Small Business Innovation in Clinical Trials (U44 Clinical Trial Optional)","solicitation_number":"PAR-21-224","program":"SBIR","phase":"BOTH","agency":"Department of Health and Human Services","branch":"National Institutes of Health","solicitation_year":"2021","release_date":"2021-05-05","open_date":"2021-08-05","close_date":"2024-04-06","application_due_date":["2021-09-06","2022-01-05","2022-04-05","2022-09-05","2023-01-05","2023-04-05","2023-09-05","2024-01-05","2024-04-05"],"occurrence_number":null,"sbir_solicitation_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/1972469","solicitation_agency_url":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/PA-files/PAR-21-224.html","current_status":"open","solicitation_topics":[{"topic_title":"NeuroNEXT Small Business Innovation in Clinical Trials (U44 Clinical Trial Optional)","branch":"National Institutes of Health","topic_number":"PAR-21-224","topic_description":"Purpose:\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the cooperation and partnering of public and private funding organizations, universities, academic medical centers, research institutes, contract research organizations, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies, NINDS has formed the Neurology Network of Excellence in Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT, www.NeuroNEXT.org). NeuroNEXT has a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and a group of 25 geographically distributed clinical sites. This clinical research network develops and conducts multiple, scientifically sound, possibly biomarker-informed exploratory clinical trials evaluating the most promising therapies, whether from academic, foundation or industry discoveries. Examples include Phase 2 clinical trials and clinical research studies aimed at validating biomarkers and clinical outcomes in preparation for clinical trials. A separate clinical trials network has been established and funded by NINDS to conduct clinical trials and biomarker studies for stroke treatment, prevention and recovery; thus NeuroNEXT has been established for the conduct of studies in neurological disorders other than stroke.\r\n\r\nNeuroNEXT provides a robust, standardized, and accessible infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols in neurological disorders affecting adult and/or pediatric populations. While the network is not specific to one disease, it has the capacity to coordinate a cadre of specialist investigators to implement studies efficiently in response to disease-specific opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe network is designed to increase the efficiency of clinical trials, to facilitate patient recruitment and retention, to increase the quality of neuroscience clinical trials, and to enable public-private partnerships.\r\n\r\nThis FOA uses the U44 cooperative agreement mechanism and is open to eligible applicants, as defined in Section III. Academic researchers may wish to consider applying through PAR-21-223\"NeuroNEXT Clinical Trials (U01)\". \"NeuroNEXT Infrastructure Resource Access (X01)\" or any reissue if they wish to gain access to the network infrastructure but do not require funds for trial costs.\r\n\r\nSince conducting the clinical trials needed for commercialization may be capital-intensive, this FOA encourages business relationships between NIH's SBIR/STTR awardees and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this FOA will give competitive preferences and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure independent third-party funds.\r\n\r\nAn objective of the SBIR and STTR programs is to foster and encourage participation in innovation and entrepreneurship by socially and economically disadvantaged persons and women-owned small businesses. This PAR encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators, including team members that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce (see data at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?TopID=2&SubID=27 and the most recent report on Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering). Such individuals include those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, those with disabilities, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\r\n\r\nDefinitions:\r\n\r\nFor this funding opportunity announcement, Phase I and II clinical studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. SBIR Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.\r\n\r\nScope of the Program:\r\n\r\nThis FOA encourages Fast Track, Phase II, and Phase IIB SBIR applications for exploratory clinical trials of investigational agents (drugs, biologics, surgical therapies or devices) that may contribute to the justification for and provide the data required for designing a future trial, for biomarker validation studies, or for proof of mechanism clinical studies. Applications for drugs or biologics should be supported by compelling scientific evidence that the investigational agent proposed for study will reach/act upon the designated target or that its mechanism of action is such that it is expected to be of benefit in ameliorating a specific aspect of the disease. Neurologic diseases chosen for study must fall within the primary responsibility of NINDS (www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/index.htm). Multi-site studies in stroke prevention, treatment and/or recovery are not appropriate for this FOA; those studies would be considered by NIH StrokeNet: http://www.nihstrokenet.org/. Separate clinical trial networks also exist for the conduct of studies in neurological emergencies (SIREN: https://siren.network/) and pain (EPPIC-NET: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Trans-Agency-Activities/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative/NINDS-Role-HEAL-Initiative-EPPIC). Studies on these topics should be directed to the dedicated networks. Studies primarily focused on biomarker validation may also apply to one of the NINDS Biomarker funding opportunities https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Focus-Tools-Topics/Biomarkers.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 clinical trials should be directed to the exploratory clinical trial FOA (PAR-18-420 and PAR-18-617). Phase 1b/2a trials requiring multi-center implementation can be considered under this FOA.\r\n\r\nApplications in rare diseases are encouraged while recognizing that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements normally required to establish the efficacy of an intervention. NINDS acknowledges that innovative, non-traditional trial designs including adaptive designs may be appropriate in rare disease studies. While NeuroNEXT is primarily intended for exploratory trials, the network will consider Phase II/III trials in diseases with a US prevalence of under 5,000 persons.\r\n\r\nExamples of appropriate studies under this FOA include, but are not limited to, those designed to:\r\n\r\nEvaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in the target population.\r\nEvaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., biomarker activity, pharmacodynamic response, target engagement, dose-response trends) in a human \"proof of concept\" trial.\r\nSelect or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, safety data, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials).\r\nEvaluate biological activity relative to clinical endpoints.\r\nApplications seeking to obtain data needed for pharmacometric modeling are encouraged, with the ultimate aim of enabling the optimal design of a future efficacy trial of an intervention.\r\n\r\nFor medical devices, in addition to providing initial clinical safety data, appropriate studies are those that inform the next phase of development, usually by finalizing the device design, establishing operator technique, and/or finalizing the choice of study endpoints for the design of a pivotal clinical trial.\r\n\r\nFast Track Studies should implement clear go-no go criteria for continuing to the next Phase II SBIR. When possible, all studies should also include go-no go criteria for proceeding to the next trial phase after the Phase II award. These should be biomarker-informed wherever possible. https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/qualification-process-drug-development-tools-guidance-industry-and-fda-staff\r\n\r\nThis FOA is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to confirm efficacy of a proposed intervention.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n\r\nApplicants should make note of the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Applicants to this FOA will be required to incorporate the NeuroNEXT infrastructure (www.neuronext.org) into their proposed study. Additional (ad-hoc) sites may be proposed to fulfill specific study requirements. All applicants will be required to use the master clinical trial agreements and central IRB that have been established for NeuroNEXT.\r\n\r\n(2) Rationale: Exploratory trials primarily test hypotheses in relatively small programs so that the acceptable risk and uncertainty are higher than in later stage programs. Exploratory clinical trials must anchor their rationale in (1) an unmet medical need; (2) a plausible biological mechanism; (3) non-clinical (in vitro and/or in vivo) data; and/or (4) early clinical data. Their individual weight should be carefully assessed in the specific context of the application at hand.; there is no requirement to provide support from all four areas. However, supporting data should be robust enough to justify the proposed phase of study. Applicants should consider the limitations of those studies with regards to the scientific rigor guidelines published by NINDS (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-11-023.html). Preclinical data (such as from animal studies) that do not sufficiently meet the rigor guidelines or are not sufficiently associated with the human condition may be inadequate to support the rationale for the study.\r\n\r\n(3) Secondary Aims:\r\n\r\nIssues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures may be addressed as secondary aims in an exploratory clinical trial, but not as the primary aim. Examples of such secondary aims include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nDetermining the optimal measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention,\r\nCollecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers,\r\nFor Early Feasibility or Traditional Feasibility studies of medical devices, issues of study feasibility and refinement of study procedures are expected to be addressed as primary aims in addition to providing initial clinical safety data at this stage. These may include:\r\nIdentifying appropriate modifications to the procedure or device to enable a subsequent Pivotal study on a finalized system;\r\nRefining the intended use population;\r\nDeveloping and refining data collection procedures;\r\nRefining the non-clinical test plans or methodologies; and\r\nDeveloping subsequent clinical study protocols.\r\n(4) The NIH recognizes that devices can vary greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. Consequently, the appropriate pathway to market may require a traditional Feasibility and Pivotal study in support of an eventual Pre-Market Approval submission, or may require a more limited study to address specific issues in support of an FDA 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. Clinical studies involving devices may utilize the entire NeuroNEXT Network, or a more limited subset of centers selected based on appropriate expertise for the given device. Investigators are encouraged to contact NINDS Scientific/Research Staff as early as possible to discuss how the NeuroNEXT network may best be utilized in support of their specific device project.\r\n\r\nNINDS anticipates that the majority of device projects utilizing NeuroNEXT will be traditional Feasibility Studies in order to best leverage the advantages of the network. A Traditional Feasibility Study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan a Pivotal Study. If an Early Feasibility Study is proposed, it should be designed in accordance with FDA's draft guidance, \"Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human (FIH) Studies\", to allow for early clinical evaluation of devices to provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data while device design and operations are still in development. Early Feasibility and Traditional Feasibility study designs may include single-arm case series, on-off interventions (patients as own controls), device-device comparisons, comparisons to historic controls, comparisons to performance controls, or adaptive/Bayesian designs.\r\n\r\n(5) Rare Diseases: Applications in rare diseases are encouraged while recognizing that available patient pools may not be adequate to meet the sample size requirements normally required to establish the efficacy of an intervention. NINDS acknowledges that innovative, non-traditional trial designs including adaptive designs may be appropriate in rare disease studies. Regardless of the design it is especially important to ensure that the study design and statistical analysis plans will meet the stated objectives,and allow for the most efficient evaluation of the limited subjects. The application should clearly demonstrate recruitment feasibility at the participating sites and applicants are encouraged to fully engage patient advocacy groups or similar representatives of the affected disease community in study design, execution, and reporting. While NeuroNEXT is primarily intended for exploratory trials, the network will consider Phase 2/3 trials in diseases with a US prevalence of under 5,000 persons.\r\n\r\n(6) The award and continuation of funding are subject to milestones to be specified in the notice of grant award according to NINDS policies.\r\n\r\n(7) NIH Resources: As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to make use of the following resources for clinical research including:\r\n\r\n(a) Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (https://ncats.nih.gov/ctsa);\r\n\r\n(b) NeuroQOL (http://www.neuroqol.org);\r\n\r\n(c) NIH Toolbox (http://www.nihtoolbox.org);\r\n\r\n(d) PROMIS (http://www.nihpromis.org); and\r\n\r\n(e) NINDS Common Data Elements (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov).\r\n\r\n(8) Mobile Technologies: Applicants are encouraged to consider utilizing (at least experimentally) mobile technologies to facilitate data collection and protocol adherence on the part of research participants and study site staff.\r\n\r\n(9) For Biomarker Validation Studies, biomarkers are defined as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions.

The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.\r\n\r\nThe development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the \u201cValley of Death\u201d).

Midstage clinical studies will generally include randomization and blinding and should yield data that allow a clear go/no-go decision regarding whether the intervention should proceed to an efficacy trial. All applications must outline specific plans for future development in the event of promising results.\r\n\r\nThis FOA is not intended to support the conduct of a clinical trial where the primary aim is to establish or confirm definitive efficacy. Applications to implement definitive efficacy trials (e.g., Phase 3 clinical trials of drugs or Pivotal device trials) should be submitted to NINDS Efficacy Clinical Trials (U01). Renewal applications of SBIR Phase II awards (i.e., SBIR Phase IIB) to conduct Phase I and II clinical studies should be submitted to NINDS Renewal Awards of SBIR Phase II Grants (Phase IIB) for Pre-Clinical Research (R44).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this FOA is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the FOA aims to facilitate the transition of clinical-stage projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH\u2019s SBIR/STTR awardees and third-party investors and/or strategic partners.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\nFor this funding opportunity announcement Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies or trials refer to the common phases of a clinical trial. SBIR Phase I and II refer to the project phases of the SBIR program.\r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives\r\n\r\nScientific/Technical Scope\r\n\r\nExamples of appropriate studies under this FOA include, but are not limited to, those designed to:\r\n\r\nEvaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in healthy volunteers or the target population.\r\nEvaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., target engagement, dose-response trends, pharmacodynamic response) in a human \"proof of concept\" trial.\r\nSelect or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy (e.g., futility trials).\r\nFor devices: Establish proof-of-principle and optimize techniques, operation, and usability of a device; inform the final device design decisions; and estimate the magnitude of treatment effect.\r\nNINDS recognizes that devices can differ greatly in terms of basic form and function, physiological bases for therapy, degree of invasiveness, etc. A Pivotal device study, for example, could potentially be used in support of an off-label indication of an existing market approved device, or to provide evidence for a novel device design in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), 510(k) or 510(k) De Novo submission. Due to the broad scope of possible medical devices and the varied nature of the regulatory path, investigators considering applications to evaluate devices are strongly encouraged to contact Scientific/Research Staff as early as possible to discuss these issues and determine the suitability of their project for this funding mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis PAR encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators, including team members that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce. Fostering diversity by encouraging the participation of individuals from nationally underrepresented groups in the scientific research workforce is longstanding interest of Congress, and a key component of the NIH strategy to identify, develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital (e.g., Public Law 114-329, American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017, and Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity,\u202fNOT-OD-20-031). Scientists and trainees from underrepresented backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems.\u202fIncreasing participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses is also critical to the success of the SBIR and STTR programs.\u202f\r\n\r\nIndependent Third-Party Partners\r\n\r\nAs significant funding is often needed to take regulated clinical projects to market beyond initial clinical studies, we encourage applicants to develop business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR fundingThird-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an \u201cangel\u201d investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any combination of the above. In light of these goals, the NINDS strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in the commercialization of emerging biomedical technologies.\r\n\r\nThat said, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development.

It provides an important funding mechanism for bringing new interventions to patients and clinicians. The SBIR program is structured in three phases. The objective in Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of a proposed research and development (R&D) effort, while in Phase II it is to continue the R&D effort for successful Phase I projects. The expectation is that in Phase III, a Small Business Concern (SBC) will be able to launch a product commercially with non-SBIR funds. \r\n\r\nHowever, many projects initiated with SBIR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR Phase II award to complete the validation studies required to obtain regulatory approval and launch a product. In particular, the development of therapeutics, medical devices, and combined technologies often requires a number of years and substantial capital investments because of the costs associated with conducting clinical trials and/or other steps mandated by the Federal regulatory approval process. \r\n\r\nCompanies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive at preclinical or early clinical stages of development to investors and strategic partners. In addition, many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically diverse patient populations. \r\n\r\nThus, despite the extensive R&D performed on such products during Phase II projects, the results are often insufficient to attract the substantial private investment needed for the eventual commercialization of the product. Many small businesses therefore become cash-starved before reaching the next critical milestone along the path toward commercialization.? Hence, this FOA is designed to address this funding gap between the end of the SBIR or STTR Phase II award and the point at which non-SBIR financing can be secured for the subsequent stages of product development. \r\n\r\nA number of public and private organizations recognize the challenges associated with this funding gap and are taking steps to provide additional resources to advance a greater number of promising early-stage technologies toward commercialization. Importantly, many of these organizations are not only providing financial support but are also establishing programs to provide commercialization guidance. For example, in the area of drug development, a number of major pharmaceutical firms have developed corporate venture funds focused on supporting projects in the preclinical stages of development, and some of these firms have established technology incubators to provide development support, including regulatory guidance. In addition, a growing number of universities are creating venture funds to support innovative technologies developed by their resident investigators, and numerous state-sponsored technology funds have also been created across the U.S. to support start-up companies. In the rare disease area, patient advocacy groups and foundations have organized to accelerate progress in the development of treatments for their disease. \r\n\r\nSuch programs can provide additional financing and commercialization support for SBIR awardees that have received initial seed funding and a rigorous technical evaluation through the NIH peer review process. As such, a major goal of this FOA is to provide a platform to incentivize partnerships between NIH-funded SBIR awardees and a broad range of potential third-party investors.?It is anticipated that funding by third-party investors will be predicated on significant due diligence, thus encouraging awardees to formulate credible business plans for product commercialization. In addition, it is expected that third-party investors will maintain an active role in supporting the awardee during the product development phase and during pursuit of follow-on funding for commercialization. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives for SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award Applications \r\n\r\nA. Independent Third-Party Investor Funds \r\n\r\nThis FOA specifically encourages business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products whose development was initiated with SBIR funding. Applicants are expected to leverage their previous SBIR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NHLBI funding under this FOA, to attract and negotiate third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant\u2019s ability to secure independent third-party investor funds that equal or exceed one-third of the total amount of the NHLBI funds being requested over the entire Phase IIB Small Market Award project period will help to validate the commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR projects solicited under this FOA. This potential will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. \r\n\r\nIf a Phase IIB Small Market Award application is selected for funding, the applicant\u2019s plan for securing independent third-party investor funds (i.e., the Finance Plan submitted as part of the application) will become a term of award as described in Section VI.1 Award Notices. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors will involve a considerable level of project due diligence by the private sector, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. In light of these goals, the NHLBI strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in commercializing emerging biomedical technologies addressing rare diseases or young pediatric populations, as well as engaging with the patient advocacy groups and foundations that focus on the indication of the developing technology.?Applicants are encouraged to explore existing resources and groups to engage with the relevant communities, such as the?NCATS Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), the?NCATS Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program, the?National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD),?FasterCures, and the?Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute(PCORI). \r\n\r\nB. Scientific/Technical Scope \r\n\r\nThe technical and commercial objectives described in the SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award application MUST represent an extension of the development efforts that were pursued in a previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II award. It is essential that significant progress was accomplished during the current/preceding SBIR or STTR Phase II project and that the proposed product has significant commercial potential. Applicants are expected to demonstrate that the proposed product has a clear advantage over existing and/or competing products and to define an appropriate path toward ultimate product commercialization. \r\n\r\nThis FOA is specifically designed to provide additional support for products that require ultimate approval/clearance by a Federal regulatory agency and those that are small markets or for rare diseases. In these circumstances, it is critically important for Federal investment to de-risk investment by third parties.\r\n\r\nAlthough projects previously funded by another NIH Institute/Center or another Federal agency are eligible for funding under this FOA, proposed projects MUST be relevant to the NHLBI mission. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the NHLBI Scientific/Research Contact (listed in Section VII) to discuss whether their proposed project meets this criterion. \r\n\r\nThe NHLBI supports development of technologies to detect, prevent, or treat cardiovascular, lung, blood and sleep disorders. It also supports research on the clinical use of blood and all aspects of the management and safety of blood resources. The NHLBI SBIR/STTR program fosters basic, applied, and clinical research on products related to the?mission?of the NHLBI. The NHLBI program priority areas for technology development research are listed below. \r\n\r\nNCATS intends to co-fund applications that meet the NCATS mission to develop innovations that reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational science process, to speed the development and delivery of new drugs, diagnostics, medical devices and behavioral interventions to patients. Additionally, NCATS is interested in co-funding applications that address rare diseases, and in particular, that can help speed the development of treatments for multiple rare diseases. For a description of the NCATS SBIR/STTR research priorities, please refer to?http://ncats.nih.gov/smallbusiness/priorities. \r\n\r\nThe NHLBI program priority areas for technology development research include: \r\n\r\nBlood Diseases and Resources areas: \r\n\r\nIn vitro diagnostic devices and therapeutic biologics, devices, and drugs for rare diseases, and diseases affecting young children and neonates, including, but not limited to: coagulation and other laboratory based assays; transfusion/infusion and non-transfusion/non-infusion treatments for bleeding complications in acquired and inherited bleeding disorders; point of care diagnostics for Sickle Cell Disease and other hemoglobinopathies to facilitate testing in low resource settings to provide earlier diagnosis and access to medical interventions; devices that facilitate transfusion of small volumes of blood components; and long-term, indwelling catheters for transfusion, blood sample collection or medication administration that provide very low thrombosis/infection risk. Other blood disease and resource areas may be proposed, as areas of interest are not limited to those listed. \r\n\r\nCardiovascular Diseases areas: \r\n\r\nDiagnostics, therapeutics (including cell and gene therapies), or instruments for treating congenital or acquired heart disease in young pediatric populations, including heart pumps and valves, atrial septal defect closure devices, surgical tools, and devices for cardiac catheterization; diagnostics and therapies for rare arrhythmias (such as LQTS-1, -2, and -3, Brugada's, and Timothy's syndromes) and lipid disorders (such as lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase or lipoprotein deficiencies or genetic diseases such as Pompedisease); technologies, instruments, and therapeutics for heart (and lung) transplantation, including devices for perfusion of donor organs and technologies for less invasive tissue biopsies and detection of organ rejection. Other cardiovascular disease areas may be proposed, as areas of interest are not limited to those listed.\r\n\r\nLung Diseases areas: \r\n\r\nDiagnostics and therapeutics for rare lung diseases and those affecting young pediatric populations, including, but not limited to: respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, adult and pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension, adult and childhood interstitial lung diseases, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and sarcoidosis. Examples include, but are not limited to, noninvasive monitoring of cardiopulmonary function for neonates and young children, portable imaging systems compatible with Intensive Care Unit environments, therapies to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia, improved aerosol delivery devices for young children, portable home diagnostic and treatment devices for sleep disordered breathing in young pediatric populations. Other lung disease areas may be proposed, as areas of interest are not limited to those listed. \r\n\r\nExamples of appropriate development activities to be proposed under this FOA include, but are not limited to, the following areas: \r\n\r\nFor projects pertaining to the development of therapeutics - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or clinical studies to support the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) and/or Biological License Application (BLA). \r\n\r\nFor projects pertaining to imaging technologies, interventional devices, and in vivo diagnostics - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of a 510(k) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, or an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. \r\n\r\nFor projects pertaining to ex vivo or in vitro diagnostics, prognostics, and screening tests - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of a 510(k) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and/or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, as needed for the specific technology/system/assay. \r\n\r\nNHLBI expects that activities to be pursued under this FOA should address any relevant requirements for clinical validation and regulatory approval, as necessary and required for commercialization of the technology. Specific activities to be proposed will vary among applications. \r\n\r\nC. Plan for Full Commercialization (all applications) \r\n\r\nThe goal of the SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award is to advance SBIR Phase II projects toward ultimate commercialization. All applicants are expected to describe a realistic plan (extending beyond the SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award project period) that outlines how and when full commercialization can be accomplished. The long-term commercialization strategy should be developed as part of the Commercialization Plan. The full commercialization plan for the product should extend beyond the period of SBIR funding. \r\n\r\nApplicants are encouraged to leverage other available Federal resources where appropriate, including existing FDA incentives to increase and accelerate small market product development, such as Orphan Drug designation, Humanitarian Device Exemption, the Pediatric Exclusivity Provision, and the?Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program?to assist with expenses related to clinical trials. Additional information about relevant FDA programs and resources may be found on the?Developing Products for Rare Diseases & Conditions?industry page. ? \r\n\r\nSee?Section VIII. Other Information?for award authorities and regulations. \r\n\r\nCriteria for Complete, Compliant, and Responsive Applications \r\n\r\nApplications deemed to be non-responsive will not proceed to review.

It provides an important funding mechanism for bringing new interventions to patients and clinicians. The SBIR program is structured in three phases. The objective in Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of a proposed research and development (R&D) effort, while in Phase II it is to continue the R&D effort for successful Phase I projects. The expectation is that in Phase III, an SBC will be able to launch a product commercially with non-SBIR funds.\r\n\r\nHowever, many projects initiated with SBIR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR Phase II award to complete the validation studies required to obtain regulatory approval and launch a product. In particular, the development of therapeutics, medical devices, and combined technologies often requires a number of years and substantial capital investments because of the costs assciated with conducting clinical trials and/or other steps mandated by the Federal regulatory approval process.\r\n\r\nThus, despite the extensive R&D performed on such products during Phase II projects, the results are often insufficient to attract the substantial private investment needed for the eventual commercialization of the product. Many small businesses, therefore, become cash-starved before reaching the next critical milestone along the path toward commercialization.? Hence, this FOA is designed to address this funding gap between the end of the SBIR or STTR Phase II award and the point at which non-SBIR financing can be secured for the subsequent stages of product development.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA number of public and private organizations have begun to recognize the challenges associated with this funding gap and are taking steps to provide additional resources to advance a greater number of promising early-stage technologies toward commercialization. Importantly, many of these organizations are not only providing financial support but are also establishing programs to provide commercialization guidance. For example, in the area of drug development, a number of major pharmaceutical firms have developed corporate venture funds focused on supporting projects in the preclinical stages of development, and some of these firms have established technology incubators to provide development support, including regulatory guidance. In addition, a growing number of universities are creating venture funds to support innovative technologies developed by their resident investigators, and numerous state-sponsored technology funds have also been created across the U.S. to support start-up companies. Such programs can provide additional financing and commercialization support for SBIR awardees that have received initial seed funding and a rigorous technical evaluation through the NIH peer review process. As such, a major goal of this FOA is to provide a platform to incentivize partnerships between NIH-funded SBIR awardees and a broad range of potential third-party investors. It is anticipated that funding by third-party investors will be predicated on significant due diligence, thus encouraging awardees to formulate credible business plans for product commercialization. In addition, it is expected that third-party investors will maintain an active role in supporting the awardee during the product development phase and during pursuit of follow-on funding for commercialization. \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives for SBIR Phase IIB Bridge Award Applications \r\n\r\nA. Independent Third-Party Investor Funds \r\n\r\nThis FOA specifically encourages business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products whose development was initiated with SBIR or STTR funding. Applicants are expected to leverage their previous SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NHLBI funding under this FOA, to attract and negotiate third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant\u2019s ability to secure independent third-party investor funds that equal or exceed the total amount of the NHLBI funds being requested over the entire Phase IIB Bridge Award project period will help to validate the commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR projects solicited under this FOA. This potential will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. \r\n\r\nIf a Phase IIB Bridge Award application is selected for funding, the applicant\u2019s plan for securing independent third-party investor funds (i.e., the Finance Plan submitted as part of the application) will become a term of award as described in Section VI.1 Award Notices. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors will involve a considerable level of project due diligence by the private sector, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. In light of these goals, the NHLBI strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in commercializing emerging biomedical technologies. \r\n\r\nB. Scientific/Technical Scope \r\n\r\nThe technical and commercial objectives described in the SBIR Phase IIB Bridge Award application MUST represent an extension of the development efforts that were pursued in a previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II award. It is essential that significant progress was accomplished during the current/preceding SBIR or STTR Phase II project and that the proposed product has significant commercial potential. Applicants are expected to demonstrate that the proposed product has a clear advantage over existing and/or competing products and to define an appropriate path toward ultimate product commercialization. \r\n\r\nThis FOA is specifically designed to provide additional support for products that require ultimate approval/clearance by a Federal regulatory agency. \r\n\r\nAlthough projects previously funded by another NIH Institute/Center or another Federal agency are eligible for funding under this FOA, proposed projects MUST be relevant to the NHLBI?mission. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the NHLBI to discuss whether their proposed project meets this criterion. The NHLBI supports development of technologies to detect, prevent, or treat cardiovascular, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. It also supports research on the clinical use of blood and all aspects of the management and safety of blood resources. The NHLBI SBIR/STTR program fosters basic, applied, and clinical research on products related to the?mission?of the NHLBI. The NHLBI program priority areas for technology development research include: \r\n\r\nCardiovascular Diseases areas:? heart failure, atherothrombosis, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation along with other atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, adult and pediatric congenital heart disease, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, and obesity, acquired valve disease, cardiomyopathies, and peripheral vascular diseases. \r\n\r\nLung Diseases areas:? asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, respiratory neurobiology, sleep-disordered breathing, critical care, and acute lung injury, developmental biology and pediatric pulmonary diseases, immunologic and fibrotic pulmonary disease, rare lung disorders, pulmonary vascular disease, and pulmonary complications of AIDS and tuberculosis. \r\n\r\nBlood Diseases and Resources areas: sickle cell disease (SCD), the thalassemias, Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and other bone marrow failure syndromes, iron chelation, fetal hemoglobin production, white blood cell disorders, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and novel cell-based therapies, transfusion medicine (red blood cells, platelets, and plasma) and blood banking including technologies to store, process, and screen blood, thrombosis and hemostatic disorders including but not limited to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemophilia, and coagulation factor deficiencies and disorders. \r\n\r\nRare diseases: Please note that the companion NHLBI SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Awards funding opportunity,?RFA-HL-23-008, supports the development of products addressing rare and pediatric diseases.  Applicants working with applications in this area are encouraged to consider this funding opportunity.\r\n\r\nExamples of appropriate development activities to be proposed under this FOA include, but are not limited to the following areas: \r\n\r\nFor projects pertaining to the development of therapeutics - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or clinical studies to support the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) and/or Biological License Application (BLA). \r\n\r\nFor projects pertaining to imaging technologies, interventional devices, and in vivo diagnostics - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of a 510(k) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, or an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. \r\n\r\nFor projects pertaining to ex vivo or in vitro diagnostics, prognostics, and screening tests - Applicants are expected to propose activities that will lead to the successful filing of a 510(k) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and/or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, as needed for the specific technology/system/assay. \r\n\r\nNHLBI expects that activities to be pursued under this FOA will address any relevant requirements for clinical validation and regulatory approval, as necessary and required for commercialization of the technology. Specific activities to be proposed will vary among applications. \r\n\r\nC. Plan for Full Commercialization\r\n\r\nThe goal of the SBIR Phase IIB Bridge Award is to advance SBIR or STTR Phase II projects toward ultimate commercialization. All applicants are expected to describe a realistic plan (extending beyond the SBIR Phase IIB Bridge Award project period) that outlines how and when full commercialization can be accomplished. The long-term commercialization strategy should be presented as part of the 12-page Commercialization Plan. The full commercialization plan for the product should extend beyond the period of SBIR funding. \r\n\r\n?Criteria for Complete, Compliant, and Responsive Applications \r\n\r\nApplications deemed to be non-responsive will not proceed to review.

Purpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to encourage investigators to pursue translational activities and small clinical studies to advance the development of therapeutic, and diagnostic devices for disorders that affect the nervous or neuromuscular systems. Activities supported in this program include implementation of clinical prototype devices, non-clinical safety and efficacy testing, design verification and validation activities, obtaining an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for a Significant Risk (SR) study or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) study, as well as a subsequent small clinical study. The clinical study is expected to provide information about the device function or final design that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use. This FOA is a milestone-driven cooperative agreement program and will involve participation of NIH program staff in negotiating the final project plan before award and monitoring of research progress.\r\n\r\nB. Overview\r\n\r\nThis FOA supports non-clinical testing to enable IRB and/or FDA approval needed to conduct a small clinical study, and the subsequent study itself (e.g., Early Feasibility Study - https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm279103). All projects will be Fast-Track applications and have two phases. SBIR Phase I will support non-clinical translational device activities to obtain an IDE and IRB approval for an SR clinical study, or to obtain IRB approval for an NSR clinical study. The duration of SBIR Phase I will depend on the maturity of the project at entry. Phase II will support a small clinical study and can last up to three years, however, the total project period (including both phases) must not exceed five years. Projects for which only a clinical phase is proposed are outside of the scope of this funding opportunity. Only those SBIR Phase I projects that have met specific criteria (see below) will be eligible for transition to SBIR Phase II after NIH administrative review. Furthermore, ethical considerations are intrinsic to the responsible conduct of neuroscience research and the translation of neuroscience advances (scientific and technological) into clinical practice. It is expected the immediate next steps following completion of the small clinical study supported under this cooperative agreement will be:\r\n\r\na marketing application if only a small clinical study or experience is needed to demonstrate the device is safe and effective.\r\na larger clinical trial that will lead to a marketing application; or\r\ndevice design decisions made based on the information and data collected.\r\nAs applicants must have comprehensive supporting data, innovation and impact will in part be judged on presenting a credible path towards U.S. regulatory submission/IRB approval at the end of the SBIR Phase I project period, and on the potential to advance the care of patients by addressing an unmet clinical need.\r\n\r\nThis FOA will utilize a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) U44 cooperative agreement. As a cooperative agreement, this FOA supports milestone-driven projects and involves NIH program staff\u2019s participation in negotiating project and milestone plan before award, monitoring the research progress, and making go/no-go decisions. The expectations of the program are in line with those of industry regarding the advancement of devices through the developmental and translational pipelines. As such, an inherent rate of attrition is possible within this program.\r\n\r\nApplicants are strongly advised to contact the Scientific/Research contact listed below prior to submission.\r\n\r\nC. Scope\r\n\r\nProjects must focus on a disorder that falls within the mission of NINDS. It is expected that devices within the scope of this program either:\r\n\r\nare very close to the 'final system' and manufactured using very close to the same manufacturing process as the device to be marketed or studied in a larger clinical trial following the completion of this project; or\r\nhave received Pre-Submission feedback from the FDA (see https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/products-and-medical-procedures/neurological-devices and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0zPKPLW2mU for helpful resources); or\r\nrequire early feasibility clinical data to inform the final device design or manufacturing processes; or\r\nare already approved, but are being used for a novel indication, target, or patient population.\r\nD. Entry criteria:\r\n\r\nFor entry to the program, projects should have:\r\n\r\nComprehensive supporting data based on bench, in vitro, and/or in vivo models representative of the intended patient population and indication.\r\nIdentified one or more clinically meaningful device outcome measures based on input from key stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, patients, and caregivers) as well as supporting literature.\r\nA compelling case for a successful IDE submission for an SR study, or IRB approval for an NSR study at the end of SBIR Phase I. All regulatory approvals must be in place prior to the start of the SBIR Phase II.\r\nApplicants are encouraged, but not required, to consult with FDA via a Pre-Submission meeting, study risk designation request, and/or 513(g) submission prior to applying for funding through this grant mechanism. Applicants who do not have sufficiently relevant feedback from the FDA regarding all planned activities prior to application for funding will be expected to do so as the first milestone during the first year of SBIR Phase I of the award. Funding will be restricted to a maximum of $100,000 in direct costs until FDA feedback that is consistent with the likely success of the regulatory path to market and overall device development plan outlined in the grant application is received. In the event that FDA feedback is not consistent with the plans in the grant, program staff will evaluate the concerns and change of scope that would be needed and work with the investigators to determine the most appropriate course of action. Any remaining funds associated with the original award will not be released.\r\n\r\nE. Phases\r\n\r\nSBIR Phase I scope:\r\n\r\nExamples of studies that may be proposed during SBIR Phase I include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nNon-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) animal studies to develop surgical techniques relevant to the device, optimize relevant therapeutic or diagnostic parameters, and refine device design as necessary for subsequent GLP testing or additional clinical studies for regulatory approval.\r\nBench-top and animal testing to demonstrate compliance with FDA Recognized Standards.\r\nGLP compliant large animal model safety and/or testing of an implanted device.\r\nActivities to become current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant.\r\nActivities to bring the development process under Design and Quality Systems Control,\r\nDevice, software, and firmware design verification and validation activities.\r\nDevelopment of packaging, connectors, and other accessories necessary for the translation of this technology.\r\nRegulatory activities, including pre-submission meetings with FDA, IDE submission, or other FDA regulatory submissions (e.g., Humanitarian Device Exemption (HED), Request for Risk Designation, 513(g) submission).\r\nA limited clinical experience is also allowable during SBIR Phase I if it is necessary to support the IDE submission for the small clinical study conducted in SBIR Phase II. Clinical studies in SBIR Phase I are out of scope if the planned SBIR Phase II small clinical study is NSR.\r\nSBIR Phase II scope:\r\n\r\nSBIR Phase II will support a small clinical study that will lead to either:\r\n\r\nA marketing application if only a small clinical trial or experience is needed to demonstrate the device is safe and effective, or\r\nA larger clinical trial that will lead to a marketing application; or\r\nA larger clinical study that will lead to a marketing application; or\r\nUse of the clinical experience to inform device design decisions\r\nExamples of studies that may be proposed during SBIR Phase II include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\nOptimization of the device design with respect to the human functional anatomy.\r\nIdentification of the most simple, reliable, and cost-effective device configuration for more. advanced clinical studies and eventual market approval.\r\nBasic proof-of-concept testing in human patients.\r\nStudies of the key physiological variables that may impact the function of the device in humans.\r\nInitial assessments of device safety are expected, but only in conjunction with obtaining enabling data about device design or function\r\nF. Non-Responsive Activities: Applications that include the following activities will be considered non-responsive and will be withdrawn and not reviewed:\r\n\r\nBasic research and studies of disease mechanisms;\r\nAnimal model development: all in vivo models must be well established and characterized, and available to the applicant;\r\nEfforts to develop neurotechnology for fundamental study of the nervous system;\r\nFundamental basic/applied research projects that employ existing market approved devices for their labeled uses are outside the scope of the present FOA;\r\nDelayed onset clinical studies\r\nProposals lacking a clinical study protocol included with the submission\r\nProjects focused on technologies for augmentation of healthy individuals\r\nApplications that do not include all required attachments (e.g., Gantt Chart, Long-term care plan)\r\nApplications that do not include a neuroethics section as part of the human subjects protection attachment.\r\nG. Milestones\r\n\r\nBecause device development is an inherently risky process, it is anticipated that there may be attrition as projects move through the process. Applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each objective in each year of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and efficacy that will be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project and should have quantitative success criteria associated with them (see below for details).\r\n\r\nFor each milestone, provide details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured). Specify the quantitative criteria for measuring success and the rationale used to develop and justify the quantitative criteria identified. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art in the field. Applicants are encouraged to read examples of milestones (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Apply-Funding/Application-Support-Library/Devices-Milestones).\r\n\r\nNIH program staff will contact the applicant to discuss, negotiate the proposed milestones and any changes suggested prior to funding the application. The final agreed upon and approved milestones will be specified in the Notice of Award (NoA). Progress towards achievement of the final set of milestones will be evaluated yearly by NIH program staff. Program staff may involve independent consultants or subject matter experts with relevant expertise. If justified, future milestones may be revised based on data and information obtained during the previous project period. If, based on the progress report, a funded project does not meet the milestones, funding for the project will be discontinued. In addition to milestones, the decision regarding continued funding will also be based on the overall robustness of the entire data package that adequately allows an interpretation of the results (regardless if they have been captured in the milestones), overall progress, portfolio balance and program priorities, competitive landscape, and availability of funds.\r\n\r\nNIH encourages increasing the rigor and reproducibility of observed results. In some cases, conducting additional critical experiments will be important for NIH to have confidence in making a funding decision.\r\n\r\nSBIR Phase I to Phase II transition:\r\n\r\nAn administrative review will be conducted by program staff, with potential input by independent consultants, to decide whether a SBIR Phase I project will be transitioned into SBIR Phase II based on the following:\r\n\r\nSuccessful achievement of the defined milestones for SBIR Phase I of the project;\r\nLikelihood of success in clinical testing;\r\nCompetitive landscape;\r\nProgram balance;\r\nAvailability of funds;\r\nFor significant risk studies, documentation of final or conditional approval of the IDE from the FDA;\r\nIRB approval(s);\r\nSubmission of the final clinical protocol and supporting documents to NIH for administrative review, and notification of approval by NIH;\r\nFeedback on activities involving humans subjects obtained from the NINDS Safety and Risk Assessment Committee (SARAC); and\r\nAgreement on updated timeline, milestones and budget for the clinical study.\r\nH. Quality and Compliance Requirements\r\n\r\nThe use of the Design Control and Quality Systems processes (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/design-control-guidance-medical-device-manufacturers) to the degree specified by the FDA is required. Intermediate steps in the Design Control process (e.g., design reviews, design verification, design validation, and design transfer activities) where appropriate, and IDE submission should be represented in the annual milestones. NIH recognizes that the degree to which Design Controls and Quality Systems processes are required by the FDA may vary substantially depending on the specific device. Investigators are encouraged to discuss these issues with the FDA and regulatory consultants prior to submitting an application so the extent to which these processes are required is clearly defined and verifiable in the application. Applicants should consider the Quality System requirements at the IDE stage (i.e., design controls) when preparing their device development activities.

The replacement of shielded twisted pair wire and coaxial cable with earlier generation, bandwidth-length product, multimode optical fiber has given increased immunity to electromagnetic interference, bandwidth, and throughput, and a reduction in size and weight on aircraft. The effectiveness of these systems hinges on optical communication components that realize high-per-lane throughput, low-latency, and large link budget, and are compatible with the harsh avionic environment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the future, data transmission rates of 100 Gbps and higher will be required. Substantial work has been done to realize data rates approaching this goal based on the use of multilevel signal coding, but multilevel signal encoding techniques trade off link budget and latency to achieve high-digital bandwidth. To be successful in the avionic application, existing non-return-to-zero (NRZ) signal coding with large link budget and low-latency must be maintained. There has been considerable focus on the transmitters and receivers for future optical interconnects, but limited attention to optimizing the fiber cabling. Current aircraft have a mix of fiber types that were not anticipated for such high-speed operation. Multimode optical fiber is strongly preferred over single mode optical fiber given the environmental and operating conditions. To further future proof the embedded optical cabling, the Navy seeks a new class of multimode optical fiber that can support operation of 100 Gbps and higher NRZ while maintaining efficient coupling to the optical transmitters and receivers and compatibility with military style fiber-optic termini. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe proposed optical cabling must operate across a -55 \u00b0C to +165 \u00b0C temperature range, and maintain performance upon exposure to typical naval air platform vibration, humidity, temperature, altitude, thermal shock, mechanical shock, and temperature cycling environments. The optical fiber must be compatible with lasers in the 850 to 1500 nm band operating at 100 Gbps and higher NRZ to support bandwidth in excess 10 GHz*km. Optical attenuation loss should be consistent with current OM5 multimode fiber.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design a multimode optical fiber with bandwidth > 10 GHz*km that is compatible with lasers in the S band (850 to 1050 nm) and the O-band (1260 nm to 1400 nm). Develop differential mode dispersion measurement techniques to profile the optical fiber in both the S and O band. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Optimize the fiber for high-speed operation over temperature. Measure and define specific launch conditions needed to maintain the bandwidth. Characterize link error potential as a function of connector misalignment, transmitter and receiver optical subassembly design, and environmental conditions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support transition of the technology to military aircraft platforms.

The idea is to analyze the repair effectiveness by comparing virgin AM-2 specimens to specimens artificially damaged and repaired, in terms of mechanical performance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Rapid deployment of Expeditionary Airfields (EAF) is critical to expedited military transportation and sustained presence across multiple military theaters around the world. At the core of EAF, utilization of aluminum matting, referred to as EAF AM-2 matting, is essential to lay down for air vehicles to successfully land in a variety of soil environments. Maintenance of such a system ensures prevention of premature structural failure, thereby preventing in-service landing failures and loss of life. However, AM-2 matting is often shipped back to a refurbishment facility for various reasons, one of which includes significant structural damage.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe decision to repair is influenced by the type of damage and the defect size encountered when the matting is damaged. Guidance will be provided to awardees. Damage due to forklift tines are also taken into account, where the maximum allowable hole dimensions for repair are 1.5 in. (3.81 cm) wide by 10 in. (25.4 cm) long. If the matting is damaged, the EAF Marines have to pull up and remove all of the surrounding mat to be able to remove and replace the affected piece. Depending on where the damaged mat is in the airfield the current process of removal and replacement can take a substantial amount of time and labor to complete both while downing that portion of the airfield. With the ability to rapidly repair in situ, the mean time to repair (MTTR) will be greatly decreased, thus improving the Operational Availability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe EAF Marines are an expeditionary force, therefore a premium is placed on weight, size, and maneuverability of materials, which imposes constraints on any solution. The EAF Marines must be prepared to operate in any feasible climate, a requirement that extends to their equipment as well. AM-2 matting is manufactured in either 6 ft (1.83 m) or 12 ft (3.66 m) by 1.5 in. (3.81 cm) by 2 ft (.61 m) pieces of aluminum and weigh 75 lbs (34.02 kg) or 150 lbs (68.04 kg) respectively. AM2 mats are additionally treated with nonskid coating.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe aim of this STTR topic is to enhance the repair and refurbishment capability of EAF AM-2 aluminum matting. Ultimately, an ideal application would involve on-site repair of holes and cracks that form on AM-2 matting while installed on an airfield. Areas of consideration for a potential solution should include fuel/power consumption (if needed), time to repair, and comparable mechanical properties to undamaged AM-2. The threshold for this effort is to repair the damaged aluminum AM-2 matting utilizing a preferred repair technique or method. The objective is to repair the damaged matting and provide some semblance of a friction surface for the repaired surface area.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Provide a conceptual design for a process for the repair and refurbishment of EAF AM-2 aluminum matting. Prove the engineering and economic feasibility of meeting the stated requirements through analysis and lab demonstrations. Identify specific strategies for meeting performance and reliability goals. Optimize the processing parameters for application to various hole and crack sizes on AM-2 matting specimens. Assess representative macrostructural matting specimens under flexure loading is recommended in this phase. Sustainment or improvement of mechanical properties is to be evaluated with use of the chosen repair method/technique. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Demonstrate prototype performance with AM-2 matting. Provide an estimate of costs including manufacturing. Provide a failure analysis, service life estimate, and assessment of meeting requirements. Using optimized parameters evaluated in Phase I, repairs would ideally be conducted on full-scale AM-2 matting structures (6 ft\u201312 ft) (1.83 m\u20133.66 m), and full-scale mechanical testing is to be conducted. Data sets are to be obtained and compared to existing data on AM-2 mechanical analyses.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: In partnership with the PMA and the Arresting Gear IPT, new repair/refurbishment cost and logistics estimates are to be assessed given the optimal materials and parameters established in the previous phases. This will ultimately prepare the repair method for fielding.\r\n\r\nAny aluminum paneling or matting that is utilized in commercial systems (e.g., stiffener walls for a train, aircraft fuselage paneling and floorboard repair, building materials and building structures) can be repaired with relative ease without having to replace or even remove the part from the rest of the structure or system.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWidener, C.

FSO communication is an especially compelling alternative to a radio-frequency (RF) link with external RF Interference (RFI) in RF-denied and/or contested environments. Most current proposed or deployed FSO systems are in the short wave Infrared (SWIR) regime at around 1.55 \u00b5m due to ubiquity of the laser and optical components customized for fiber-optical communications. Exceptionally high-data rates at this wavelength range are possible when atmospheric effects are not present [Ref 1] and laser-based FSO communication is the leading solution for interconnecting new constellations of low-earth-orbit satellites. Terrestrial FSO links and satellite uplinks have seen some success, but the link budget in the SWIR regime is often limited by optical obscurants such as haze, fog, clouds, atmospheric absorption, and turbulence presence in the atmosphere. SWIR links with stabilized telescopes have been demonstrated to achieve gigabit per second (Gb/s) communication between naval vessels in ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore configurations at ranges of 12 and 45 km (Ref 2), despite the link limitation to 1 km when the visibility was impaired by heavy fog. For FSO laser communications systems operating in the SWIR bands, including 1300 nm and 1550 nm, the photonic wavelength is comparable to the size of aerosols that scatter and attenuate the laser-beam propagation in the channel. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecent analysis has verified that there are advantages to using long-wave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths for FSO links through the atmosphere [Ref 3]. When the channel transmission is affected by fog, clouds, haze, dust, or turbulence, a near-IR (~ 1.55 \u00b5m wavelength) FSO link suffers significantly more attenuation relative to LWIR systems. With the exception of fog and clouds, mid-wave infrared (MWIR) systems share the advantages of LWIR and benefit from higher performance lasers and detectors, as well as reduced diffraction relative to LWIR. Unfortunately, the high-cost, low-bandwidth, and low-output power of otherwise suitable MWIR and LWIR sources has prevented their adoption for this application.\r\n\r\nQuantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) and Intraband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) have seen significant development in the past decade, to the point where devices with watt-level output are now feasible at wavelengths covering most of the MWIR, 3-5 \u00b5 and LWIR, 8\u201314 \u00b5 spectral regions. Unfortunately, the functionality of these devices is limited, particularly for laser communications, due to the lack of an appropriate modulator. The carrier population in a QCL may be modulated to ~ 100 GHz due to ultrafast carrier dynamics, but the optical modulation bandwidth is significantly less than 10 GHz due to the photon lifetime in the cavity. As the cavity is made longer to produce more power, the modulation speed is reduced by increased photon lifetime, as well as the difficulty of modulating the large current, > 1 A, required in a multi-watt device. Furthermore, high-power devices experience beam pointing instability under large-signal modulation [Ref 4]. These problems are solved in near-IR communications through external modulation and optical amplification, but optical amplification that is compatible with a modulated signal is not available over the majority of the spectral ranges of interest, nor has an appropriate modulator been demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOptical metamaterials (MMs), sub-wavelength electromagnetic structures that exhibit optical properties not readily found in natural materials [Ref 5], have huge potential for use in LWIR devices where sub-wavelength structures are > 1 \u00b5m and so may be readily fabricated with well-established lithography. These materials are presently being explored for numerous applications including tunable filters [Ref 6], multicolor IR imaging [Ref 7], ultracompact IR optical components [Ref 8], and optical switching [Ref 9]. However, to be useful as an active device such as a modulator, the metamaterial must be tunable at speeds greater than 10 GHz. Extremely compact plasmonic devices have been demonstrated for on-chip collimation, as well as other optical functions [Ref 8], but so far appear to be difficult to fabricate and lack tunability. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecently, tunable metamaterial devices based on carrier depletion have been demonstrated with the fastest published result reaching 1.5 GHz (750 MHz 3-dB bandwidth) and projected operation up to 10 GHz [Ref 10]. Further development of these materials is needed to achieve low-insertion loss, high-modulation depth, and modulation to speeds > 40 GHz. The metamaterial-based optical modulator is a viable and feasible technology and the following metrics are the Higher efficiency, longer FSO link for this project:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tThreshold\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tGoal\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPrimary Benefits\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSignal bandwidth (3-dB)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 10 GHz\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 40 GHz\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLarger data rate, lower cost per bit\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tInsertion loss\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t< 3 dB\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t< 1 dB\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHigher efficiency, longer FSO link\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tOptical output power\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 0.5 W\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 4 W\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLonger FSO link\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tOptical aperture\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 50 \u00b5\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 500 \u00b5\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLower cost (simpler alignment)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tOptical bandwidth\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 10 nm\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 100 nm\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLower cost (wavelength control)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tModulation depth\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 5%\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t> 90% \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHigher efficiency, longer FSO link\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop concepts for a tunable metamaterial-based optical modulator capable of providing dynamic narrow linewidth tunable properties within the MWIR/LWIR spectral range.

Various approaches exist to assess engine health and available power in a rotorcraft context, and the rapid evolution of machine learning and artificial intelligence is further expanding the realm of possible solutions. The development and maturation of algorithms that utilize existing aircraft data parameters and that have the potential for real-time, or near real-time performance, are of considerable interest. In particular, significant operational efficiencies can be obtained if engine performance deterioration can be accurately determined and predicted over a wide range of operating conditions. Maintenance can be planned in advance, with necessary personnel and resources pre-positioned to minimize mission and readiness impacts. Specific aircraft operating conditions that lend themselves to accurate estimation of power available may not occur with regularity, thereby limiting the potential effectiveness of any individual approach. Optimal predictive performance can be achieved by combining multiple models and algorithms via decision-fusion, ensemble learning, and so forth. An ideal solution would also provide the means to monitor and evolve the models over time, support the incorporation of new models, provide interpretability and explainability, and be broadly applicable to different engines.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design and demonstrate multiple approaches for engine health and/or power available estimation using Navy datasets and commercially available, open-source computing languages and packages (Python, etc.). Design and demonstrate technical feasibility for combining the models using machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches to improve model performance. The raw data may need to be filtered, manipulated, or normalized to enable implementation of the models. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a multimodel approach for accurately estimating and predicting engine health and/or power available over a wide range of operating conditions.

Develop tools and processes to monitor model performance and assist with long-term management.\r\n\r\nThis software capability would be broadly applicable to aerospace, turboshaft engines, and could be commercialized as an engine management tool for commercial operators.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peddareddygari, L.

Under long-range conditions, atmospheric disturbances, platform motion, and object motion often introduce blur and other artifacts in the imagery of video streams from ISR missions, limiting effectiveness. With the advance of computation hardware and algorithms, computational methods can be applied to video streams to passively enhance imagery in real time by removing blur and artifacts and in some cases providing super-resolution. These approaches have the potential to be applied to any video stream whether live or recorded. Blind deconvolution techniques are a promising approach [Refs 1-5]. This approach can provide automatic estimation of compensation parameters such as point spread function (PSF), which can then be applied to imagery for enhancement such as the increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Implementation on efficient and scalable single- or multi-GPU or other processors can ensure real-time operation with minimal latency.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy requires a real-time computational algorithm and implementation for passive video enhancement of video streams under dynamic conditions (e.g., defective pixels, non-uniform backgrounds, clipped objects, dropped frames, abrupt scene changes, significant haze, strong glint, and saturated pixels). Sustained computation rates for imagery with > 1 mega-pixels per frame or more should be 30 Hz (threshold) and 60 Hz (target) with latency of 200 ms (threshold) and 50 ms (target). Power consumption should be less than 150 W (threshold) and 50 W (target) in a compact, reliable compute module. This low size, weight, and power (SWaP) enables integration on mobile platforms and other SWaP-constrained vehicles. The computational algorithm and implementation must be automatic, providing low-latency simultaneous deblurring (100% reduction in PSF width in some cases), denoising (50% increase in SNR in some cases), and in some cases super-resolution, contrast enhancement, and glint suppression of video. The algorithms should show that in some cases deblurring reduces PSF width by 100%, and denoising increases SNR by 100%. The algorithms and hardware should ideally be future-proof and scalable to a range of mission scenarios. Trade-offs in image quality, processing speed, and hardware SWaP should be documented. Minimally this system should include: (a) software framework to use real-time video enhancement for receiving and sending real-time video with network-based message passing protocols and recorded formats; (b) read and write selected image and video file formats; (c) supporting the simultaneous processing of multiple image streams; (d) multi-stream co-aligning (registering) technique for the estimation of arbitrarily large angles of rotation and the estimation of geometric scaling factors (i.e., zoom-in or zoom-out); (e) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that displays compensated imagery in real time and enables operators with all levels of experience to easily use and configure the system; (f) techniques for mitigating the adverse effects of defects in the raw imagery and objects extending beyond the field of view; (g) techniques for automating the selection of near optimal compensation parameters; (h) performing online Multiframe Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) contrast and feature enhancement, and super-resolving imagery; (i) restoring and displaying turbulence-degraded imagery from live sensor feeds in real time; and (j) tuning of parameters and configuration for sustained, autonomous operation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a real-time video enhancement approach for tactical optical ISR systems imaging. Perform feasibility analysis of hardware and software for implementations of the system, including a study of types of video streams and under what conditions they can be enhanced and for what types of blurs, noise, and other artifacts.

The cable is connected to arresting gear below decks that absorbs the aircraft\u2019s kinetic energy and stops the aircraft. Service life of the cable under repeated mechanical loading and degradation-inducing environmental conditions is critical, since the cable is the largest driver of operational cost in the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) program. Service use cycles, as well as corrosion and bend-over-sheave wear and fatigue, are critical performance factors for such cables. To improve these characteristics, the Navy has been investigating composite carbon nanotube (CNT)/steel material as an alternative cable material to steel. The issue is manufacturability \u2013 current methods of extruding steel wire require applying 1,400\u20131,500 \u00b0C heat, which would degrade CNTs. The Navy is interested in a novel extrusion process that can effectively produce wire at a maximum 400 \u00b0C to protect the CNT properties. Additionally, process costs must be comparable to current steel-only processing costs for the CNT/steel cable to be viable. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe arresting gear cable is comprised of two separate cables: the cross-deck pendant and the purchase cable that is connected via a terminal and pin. The cross-deck pendant is the portion of the cable that is stretched across the landing area and interfaces with the aircraft tailhook. It is approximately 100 feet (30.48 m) long, and is replaced after approximately 125 cycles. The purchase cable is the portion of the cable that is reeved through the fairlead system and the arresting engine below the flight deck. It is comprised of 31 wires in a lang-lay construction, 1-7/16 in. (3.65 cm) in diameter and 2,200 ft (609.6 m) long. It is subject to bending stresses from the many sheaves, which with it is in contact, and is replaced after approximately 1,500 cycles. This composite cable SBIR topic addresses only the purchase cable. Cable construction should match current cable dimensions to facilitate direct replacement. The base metal for a new MMC cable should remain extra improved plow steel or a compositional equivalent. The nominal breaking strength of the composite cable should, at minimum, match the current cable\u2019s 215,000 lbs (97,522.35 kg), in addition to improving the bend-over-sheave fatigue life.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy requires the development of a manufacturing method capable of cost-effectively producing composite wires for arresting gear cables. The manufacturing method must be able to produce enough wire to fabricate a test batch of full-scale arresting gear purchase cables by the end of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop and demonstrate a manufacturing method capable of bulk production of enough MMC wire to manufacture arresting gear purchase cable. Perform wire-wrap testing for ductility, reverse bend testing for fatigue resistance, along with tensile strength and reduction-of-area testing to ensure that all material standards are maintained. Demonstrate production of 100 ft (30.48 m) wire lengths and show scalability to meet the 2,200 ft (670.56 m) requirements for full-scale arresting gear purchase cables. Perform a cost-and-lifecycle analysis to determine any potential savings from extending the life of the purchase cable. Prepare a Phase I Option that, if exercised, will produce a sub-scale arresting gear purchase cable for bend-over sheave lifecycle testing. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Demonstrate manufacturing of full-scale arresting gear purchase cables. Determine maximum production rate and final wire rope properties. Final demonstration shall be on a composite cable in a test environment representative of the arresting gear aboard ship, (either a test bench or arresting gear at NAVAIR Lakehurst, depending on the availability of non-SBIR funding. During a final demonstration, the composite cable will be cycled to failure, and the prototype must improve current service life and meet current performance requirements, particularly mechanical strength. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to the Navy and potential commercial use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Work with the PMA to field the technology, accounting for any requirements, restrictions, or performance parameters. The Arresting Gear IPT and pertinent engineering teams are planned to be synchronized during the entire process.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCommercial systems and infrastructure that requires high-performance load-bearing cables, as well as durable, highly conductive electronics cables can greatly benefit from the efforts in this topic, and can result in additional design flexibility.

Safety of navigation, mission logistics, operational efficacy, electromagnetic and acoustic sensor performance, and other aspects of maritime operations depend on atmospheric and oceanic conditions that change suddenly, and which are hard to predict. Environmental models, especially shore-based supercomputer models, empower the Navy to capitalize on favorable conditions and to prepare for extreme weather events. This is especially true in shallow littoral environments where conditions such as ocean currents, wind, waves, and eddies are harder to predict and are more impactful. It is therefore desirable to have an integrated environmental model as an on-board system that acquires and provides estimates of current and future environmental conditions as a service to other ship-board systems.\r\n\r\nThe Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I) currently deploys a powerful environmental modeling computer system named Navy Integrated Tactical Environment System Next (NITES-Next). NITES-Next contains a broad range of tools for tasks such as data maintenance, environmental analysis, Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) visualization, optical and radio-frequency sensor performance prediction, sonar performance prediction, environmental impact estimation, coastal environment predictions, hazard predictions, and search and rescue tools. These tools are powerful but require an on-platform operator, both to manually access shore-based predictions from FNMOC and to operate the complex modeling software environment.\r\n\r\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, on the other hand, utilizes the Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA), a web-based geographic information system (GIS) tool developed to support environmental planning and response efforts. ERMA integrates various types of data, including environmental, weather, and oceanographic information, into a centralized platform. It facilitates real-time visualization, analysis, and collaboration among response teams and stakeholders during environmental incidents such as oil spills, hazardous material releases, and natural disasters.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these capabilities, there is a growing emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) systems, specifically those focused on environmental risks. These MDA systems integrate various data sources, including environmental, weather, and oceanographic information, to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential environmental risks in the maritime domain. By monitoring and analyzing factors such as sea state, wind conditions, ocean currents, and water temperature, MDA systems can identify and assess environmental hazards that may affect naval operations.\r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks a capability for an integrated environmental system that can passively download, curate, and calculate operational parameters in an ongoing manner, making the data available to NITES, ERMA, MDA or other on-board systems. Despite the name, the current NITES-Next systems are not integrated. They primarily act as decision aids for human operators and do not provide parameters to any on-board sensors or weapon systems. The Navy aims to enhance the integration and automation of environmental data within on-board systems to streamline operations, improve situational awareness, and support timely decision-making across various naval platforms. There is currently no commercial capability that meets the Navy needs.\r\n\r\nA solution is needed for an INTEMS that provides pertinent environmental information to ship-board systems as a service. The solution must be capable of ingesting, processing, validating, and publishing environmental data from potential authoritative data sources such as FNMOC, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, or Naval Oceanographic office. It must assess the accuracy, feasibility, storage requirements, and computational requirements for each of the processes. Using the shore-based forecasts, climatology, on-board sensors, or algorithms the INTEMS shall provide parameters pertaining to surface currents, surface waves, sea state, abyssal current, salinity, temperature, thermocline depth, wind, visibility (dust, moisture, ice), precipitation, atmospheric pressure, temperature, cloud cover (type, density, height), turbulence, aircraft icing, the boundary layer, and ionospheric conditions effecting electro-magnetic signal propagation.\r\n\r\nThe INTEMS must be able to incorporate a high-fidelity regional bathymetric map to provide improved predictions of surface currents, surface waves, temperature, and salinity in littoral areas.\r\n\r\nThe INTEMS solution will be implemented, either as software that runs on an on-board Navy computer system, or as a stand-alone computer system, based on computational requirements. It must be able to process graphical or gridded database environmental estimates and forecasts into gridded environmental estimates, which will be provided as a service for other on-board systems, displays, and geophysical databases. To interface with other systems, such as NITES, the INTEMS will be compatible with Open Geospatial Consortium compliant data formats (for example, NetCDF4). The now-casts and forecasts provided by the INTEMS must be available at multiple altitudes and depths with a fine enough resolution to model atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers.\r\n\r\nThe INTEMS will be required to provide timely global nowcasts and forecasts in situations where shore-based data is fully, partially, or not available. In all cases accuracy shall exceed or match climatology, but when additional shore-based or sensor data is available, the prediction skill should exceed persistence. The system shall provide statistical maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and mean estimates based on climatology and/or incorporated shore-based forecasts. Additional figure of merit shall indicate whether or not shore-based predictions are incorporated and if the data is valid based on its quality, consistency, or inherent unpredictability (due to qualitative factors).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept of an INTEMS system. Demonstrate the INTEMS feasibly meets the parameters of the Description through analysis and modeling. The concept will be evaluated based on its soundness of the underlying analysis and the variety of environmental predictions offered. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype INTEMS based on the Phase I concept. Demonstrate functionality under the required service conditions as described in the Description. Demonstrate the prototype performance through the required range of parameters given in the Description. The INTEMS predictions will be evaluated over a multi-week period, conducted by the government and compared against both climatology and measurements occurring at distant weather stations to verify prediction accuracy and figure of merit reliability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: \r\n\r\nSupport the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. The INTEMS will be ruggedized, finalized, and adapted for integration with ship-board information systems and will undergo certification prior to final product testing on the naval platform.\r\n\r\nThis technology will benefit commercial shipping platforms, oil and gas exploration, and industrial operations in coastal regions by providing essential and up-to-date environmental data that can power decision making and enhance the ability for automated systems and sensors to compensate for environmental conditions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1.

Effective recovery and conversion of the waste heat into useful work would increase the diesel engine\u2019s thermal efficiency, resulting in a reduction in the engine\u2019s fuel consumption for equivalent work. This STTR topic seeks a SEWHRU to capture and transfer at least 50% of the heat from the exhaust flue gas to an intermediate working fluid, and on to the components that will convert the heat into useful work.\r\n\r\nWHRUs for legacy internal combustion engines exist commercially as an afterthought for prime movers. The WHRUs are dependent on the prime mover, with a WHRU that consists of a Heat Exchanger (HX) placed directly into the flue gas pathway and expected to work effectively without interfering with the operation of the prime mover. Some WHRUs designs incorporate dampers and a bypass system that redirects the flue gas around the HX; however, the legacy systems do not provide the following features that would be beneficial to the life, efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of the HX:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Controlled flow rate of the flue gas through the HX\r\n\r\n\u2022 Controlled flow rate of the working fluid through the HX\r\n\r\n\u2022 Flue gas treatment for reducing particulate matter and other contaminants\r\n\r\n\u2022 Even distribution of the flue gas through the HX\r\n\r\n\u2022 Protective mechanism or process to protect the HX from over heating\r\n\r\n\u2022 Control mechanism or process that prevents condensation within the HX\r\n\r\n\u2022 Forced air system to counteract pressure losses\r\n\r\n\u2022 Modular design to ensure maintainability\r\n\r\nThe legacy WHRUs that utilize conventional processes to recover waste heat from flue gas are plagued with multiple problems as follows: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Thermo-mechanical stress due to transient flue gas temperature profiles\r\n\r\n\u2022 Resonance within the heat exchanger when flow of the secondary fluid is secured\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintenance due to fouling and corrosion\r\n\r\n\u2022 Secondary fluid thermal and pressure constraints, decomposition limits of fluid \r\n\r\n\u2022 Unrestricted prime mover or plant operations \r\n\r\n\u2022 Effect on efficiency or power output due to exhaust stack backpressure\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA self-cleaning SEWHRU design is needed by the Navy with systems and processes incorporated and synchronized with the prime mover and the waste heat recovery system\u2019s operation sequences in order for the WHRU to work effectively. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe WHRU shall transfer heat from the diesel engine\u2019s flue gas to a working fluid with an inlet temperature range between 60 and 190 \u00b0F. Pressure drops across hot flue gas side of the WHRU shall not exceed 4 inches of water and/or interfere with the prime mover\u2019s efficiency. The heat recovery unit design shall be capable of withstanding thermal shock effects when a working fluid at 60 \u00b0F enters a 1200 \u00b0F heat exchanger. The WHRU shall possess a self-cleaning function that mitigates fouling and corrosion effect from combustion byproducts and operates with minimal operator intervention. Weight and volume of the WHRU shall be comparable or less than the prime mover\u2019s weight and size to power ratio. The WHRU shall be utilized in place of a silencer and shall be comparable to or better than the existing silencer in attenuating engine exhaust noise. The WHRU shall be scalable to 4000 Brake Horse-Power (BHP) marine diesel engines.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a self-cleaning SEWHRU that meets the needs of the Navy as defined in the Description. Evaluate the unit\u2019s economic, technical, and manufacturing feasibility and quantify the SEWHRUs efficiency and operating parameters. Demonstrate the design and manufacturing concepts through modeling, analysis, and bench top experimentation where appropriate. Document the ability and impact of scaling engine size. Include in the Phase I final report the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed solution. The Phase I Option, if exercised, should include an initial detailed design and specifications to build a prototype with the Phase II effort.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, fabricate, deliver, and test a prototype of a WHRU at an appropriate scale that captures at least 50% of the heat in the flue gas of a demonstration engine. Demonstrate the ability to withstand the flue gas temperature cycles. Validate analytic models developed in Phase I and evaluate scalability of design up to 4000 BHP. Perform testing activities that include demonstration and characterization of key parameters and objectives at the proposer\u2019s facility or other suitable testing facility identified by the offeror. Design the full-scale waste heat recovery unit for a rated diesel engine that fits in place of the existing exhaust stack silencer and integrate the unit with the rated diesel engine. Test the unit to demonstrate the ability to meet the design characteristics.

Technical limitations of current air-data system create integration challenges that degrade their utility in important DoD and civilian applications, including guidance, navigation, and control of small UASs. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe conventional approach to integration of air data system typically pairs a centralized air-data measurement system, containing mechanical or digital pressure transducers, plumbed with tubing to a relatively simple mechanical probe. Pitot-static probes provide pressure-tight connections to a small hole in the center of the rounded tip (pitot port) and to a ring of holes around the periphery of the probe (static pressure port), usually located about 5 probe diameters aft of the tip.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPressure altitude is calculated using comparison of the absolute (vacuum referenced) static pressure measurement to standard conditions of the International Standard Atmosphere. Correction for ground-level barometric pressure (e.g., as measured at the local airport) permits estimation of the local altitude above ground level \u2013 essential for altitude deconfliction of aircraft, as well as terrain and obstacle avoidance. Correction for non-standard temperature and dew point permits computation of the density altitude, which is an important factor in aircraft performance (e.g., lift, drag, and power). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUsing Bernoulli\u2019s principle, a differential pressure measurement between pitot (ram air) pressure and static (ambient) pressure indicates the airspeed in the direction of the probe. Correction for installation effects of the probe mounted to the aircraft, compressibility effects at high speed, and air density yields the calibrated, equivalent, and true airspeed, respectively. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlthough the pitot-static system has been a reliable component of manned and unmanned aviation for more than a century, several drawbacks persist, especially for integration on very small aircraft, including compact drones in wide usage by DoD and civilian operators. In many cases, these small UASs operate without airspeed / altitude sensing entirely and can only navigate with GPS, leaving them susceptible to GPS interference (intentional or unintentional). Furthermore, operation without (or with a sub-par) pitot-static system can reduce the robustness of the flight controls due to adverse weather and limit the safe flight envelope (reducing efficiency / loiter time or maximum climb / dash performance). These challenges include: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Physical space occupied by centralized air data computer systems, including individually packaged absolute and differential pressure transducers, signal conditioning, analog-to-digital conversion, and microprocessor, as well as their accompanying mechanical interfaces (tubing, quick disconnects, strain relief bracketry, etc.)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Hidden failures within pressure plumbing (e.g., leaks or obstructions) due to human error (e.g., pinched tube, contaminated connectors) or operations in a severe environment (e.g., icing, thermal / chemical / UV degradation of plastics) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Need to provide separate static pressure connection to absolute sensor and reference port of differential pressure sensor, requiring a splitter and additional tubing bulk\r\n\r\n\u2022 Pressure lags due to long tubing runs in small diameter tubing, degrading the speed, stability, and accuracy of key navigation inputs \r\n\r\n\u2022 Limited availability of commercial sensors in miniature packages with required accuracy, stability, speed, resolution, and port configuration\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reliance on separate sensors (or operator inputs) [e.g., outside air temperature] to apply proper correction factors \u2013 potentially introducing new sources of error\r\n\r\n\u2022 Scalability (number of sensors) - challenges above are compounded when multiple sources of air-data measurements are desired or required to achieve desired reliability levels\r\n\r\n\u2022 Scalability (physical size) \u2013 traditional construction relying on physical tubing interconnects between probe and readout device imposes scalability limitations preventing scaling to very small sizes, such as for integration on micro-air vehicles \r\n\r\n\u2022 Calibration of probes separately from readout equipment creates challenges for traceability and integration\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy requires development of a new class of digital pitot-static sensors that sidesteps or mitigates each of these problems. We note that the current state of practice / art in related fields \u2013 such as high-performance micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing, widespread commercialization of multi-chip/die integration of heterogenous elements within the same mechanical packages, and advancements in precision additive manufacturing and computer-aided co-design of electronic and mechanical assemblies \u2013 could readily be applied to this problem space to offer compelling solutions. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe sensor assembly should:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Have an overall outer probe tip shape consistent in proportion with accepted practice for construction of pitot-static tubes \r\n\r\n\u2022 Fit within a cylindrical volume 0.25 inches in diameter and 5 inches long.

Some solutions resort to cannibalization of parts: moving them from one ship to keep another one operational. This is a critical issue as Navy ships are getting fewer steaming hours because of growing maintenance delays and costs. Maintenance delays have resulted in some ships deferring maintenance. Over time this situation has resulted in worsening ship conditions and increased costs to repair and sustain ships. In some cases, maintenance has been deferred to the point where ships have been decommissioned several years ahead of their planned service life. With increasing computer capabilities, growing materials databases, increasing computational capabilities, the growing use and power of ML and artificial intelligence, digital engineering can reduce acquisition timelines and cost, permit more rapid system upgrades, and streamline maintenance. In addition to verified corrosion models in relevant operational environments, failure analysis, inspection reports, documented \u2018lessons learned\u2019, and the results of past maintenance practices can be incorporated into the materials database. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe challenge of digital engineering for DoD is attaining knowledge-based integration of data sufficient to decide lifecycle issues. Key elements of digital engineering are developing and compiling materials databases and developing relevant corrosion models that can predict materials behavior and operational life in platform systems operating in marine environments. ML is a powerful subset of artificial intelligence (AI) for systems to learn from data, pattern identification, and decision making. Application of ML tools can enable characterization of materials and informed-corrosion behavior in new ship design and inform Navy Maintenance personnel about options for cost-effective materials or corrosion control methods to lessen future ship maintenance. A key challenge in applying ML algorithms to materials science data is that data comes in many formats. Determining how to featurize and utilize different materials data formats so that prior data can be used as training data for ML algorithms can be difficult. Feature engineering, including extraction, transformation, and informed selection, is critical for improved ML accuracy and increase Fleet operational availability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept/approach/framework for feature engineering tools to extract critical information related to corrosion and other degradation pathways (e.g., physical, strength, fatigue resistance, etc.) from multiple formats. Key features may also include material properties, chemistry, and processing variables. Include in the concept/approach/framework appropriate identification classifiers and interactions. Assemble verified corrosion models and other descriptive terms for different materials. Develop a Phase II plan. In a Phase I option, if exercised, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept/approach to provide labeled data output for corrosion/corrosion control options.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, demonstrate, and validate a materials database for supervised (e.g., support vector, neural networks) and unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., cluster analysis) use for corrosion/corrosion control and life prediction. Ensure that the collective database is able to identify prioritization of features whether it be structural, chemical, and physical properties or AM-related processing-microstructure-property phenomena relative to corrosion phenomena.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition optimized computational/informatics handling engineering tools for commercialization in ML utilization through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or other partnering agreements.

The advent of textured ceramics has proven to be a boon to the Navy in stimulating investments that are affordably and effectively refreshing the critical national infrastructure that is acoustic transduction. The space, weight, power, performance, and cost tradeoff space has been altered by textured ceramic materials in a way that is succeeding in overcoming reluctance to considering the risk and cost of new acoustic transduction devices. On autonomous vehicles, maximum sustained performance at the lowest cost is the objective. Making multiple uses of the same, best array of acoustic sensors within an open architecture communication and control architecture to best and most affordably perform multiple missions is an opportunity large enough to subsume multiple stovepipes in legacy capabilities. While not yet so mature, compositions of textured PZT materials are of interest, but only to the extent that documented experience with the proposed material formulation is cited. Designs appropriate to future multi-mission heavy-weight torpedoes but which can be scaled / configured to meet the HF search and acoustic communications requirements of next generation UUVs and concept for their employment in the performance of a variety of missions including Mine Warfare (MIW), Naval Special Warfare (NSW), and Explosive Ordnance Demolition (EOD), while simultaneously offering higher performance back-fit options are a priority are a principal objective. Government rights to a sensor and array design concept so that stove pipes in both future and legacy systems can be mitigated is another high priority objective.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

This has the advantage of exposing the student to visual operational conditions that are motivationally immersive and hard to replicate or train to in purely live training. While VR and AR technologies are modern and alluring, use of these technologies alone does not ensure training effectiveness. Furthermore, their introduction may insulate an instructor from fully observing and adaptively interacting with the student, reducing natural and traditional student/instructor experiences. A body of knowledge in basic research addresses the effective use of VR/AR, including the need to monitor student performance and adapting the pace or content of instructional material based on this [Ref 1]. This STTR topic seeks to develop a VR/AR learning system that adapts to the student based on the competency of the student\u2019s performance and yields a learning gain that is significantly better than current training methodologies. Toward this end, the aim is to develop a working prototype and a student performance measurement approach that can be generalized across a range of classroom adaptive training environments where VR and AR could be applied.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Determine a technical approach to monitor competency of student performance while using wearable VR or AR instructional media and use such information to inform and adapt instructional content. Determine the metrics to measure student performance shortfalls, and for assessing system training effectiveness. Include designs of baseline measures that would be administered before training and a comparison measure after introducing this new approach, using any current Navy Use Case. Phase I accomplishments will be presented to cognizant ONR Program Officers for feedback before initiating Phase II activity.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Apply the Phase I approach to a representative Navy classroom training environment where VR and/or AR are, or could be, used. Implement the technical approach in a prototype and collect metrics for baseline comparison. The government will provide a representative Navy VR/AR classrooms environment if the performing team does not have access to or insight into the content and design of Navy-relevant classroom settings.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assess the training value of the approach developed in Phase II, comparing it with VR or AR-based training without the assessment and adaptivity of this approach. If the approach developed is demonstrated to be significantly better in training efficacy (speed and/or level of the students\u2019 content mastery) based on criteria agreed on by ONR and Fleet representatives, demonstrate the system to leadership in the Fleet Training Wholeness Program of Record.\r\n\r\nCommercialization opportunities should be explored in Phase II and pursued in Phase III.

Currently DoD lacks the ability for continuous remote monitoring (e.g. physiological) to inform readiness metrics under austere military conditions due to power supply limitations of commercially available wearable devices. Addressing this gap will support feedback to the individual Service Member for improved individual performance and resilience, personnel wellness across the unit, and ultimately, to inform and support decisions affecting training, readiness, and mission planning [Ref 3].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of this STTR topic is to develop a software application that can be incorporated with existing wearable devices (e.g. Android) to enable continuous remote monitoring in austere military environments. Operational environments that involve movements, such as maritime, where induced environmental motion make detection of activity levels or sleep periods particularly challenging should be addressed in device selection. Devices, at a minimum, should continuously capture heart-rate, heart-rate variability, activity/motion, timing of sleep periods and asleep/awake status across the 24-hour day, for a duration of at least 30 (threshold) or 60 (objective) days without charge. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe software application should provide onboard computing and processing of sleep and fatigue data utilizing emerging commercial applications, such as tinyML, to significantly reduce power consumption and data size. Data should be formatted in a way that can be interpreted and ingested in a database agnostic manner, and support rapid transmission to a local server. Data transmission should be conducted via wireless (e.g. Bluetooth) means. The development of this technology will greatly improve the ability to field wearable devices for long periods of time in disrupted, disconnected, intermittent and low-bandwidth environments; where understanding readiness state is critical, but ability for device recharging may not be operationally feasible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define, develop, and demonstrate ability to run software application on a commercially available wearable device that enables initial improvement for reduce power consumption and data size, and a plan for transmitting data wirelessly to local server. Define plan for reaching desired battery life with required data collection (e.g. sleep) measures, and ability to test at multiple milestones within both lab and home/operational environments. Define plan to completely turn off device in emission controlled conditions: manually (Threshold) and remotely (Objective). Phase I will result in a proof of concept for testing/demonstration only, no human subjects testing will occur.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Testing and fielding of software application with at least 50 devices within lab and home/operational environments to support verification and validation testing of power consumption rates, data formatting, and other time synchronization between device and local server. Additional testing for data transfer speeds of sleep start and stop times, and health-related summary and other time series data covering a period of 24-hours to 72-hours between devices and a disconnected database infrastructure. The prototypes applications\u2014that meet the transmission needs, onboard computing, and extended runtimes\u2014will be demonstrated in a military relevant environment. Additionally, the developed application and combined wearable will need to be interoperable with existing DoD wireless infrastructure. The prototype device will need to manage wireless transmission of health and readiness status information over a wireless link while maintaining an extended runtimes; and maintain sufficient on-device memory storage to retain multiple weeks\u2019 worth of summary information, processed sleep and performance indicators, and synchronize the saved information to the DoD support infrastructure. Interface specifications will be done in collaboration with Navy/DoD to define and develop appropriate wireless interfaces in existing data infrastructure. Provide a detailed plan that will outline the verification of the wearable device, it\u2019s sensing capabilities, communication protocol, and validation of the onboard sleep and performance analyses. The wearable device should provide at a minimum but not limited to, heart-rate, hear-rate variability, activity/motion, and asleep/awake health status information. Details of the device requirements will be provided to the Phase II awardee(s). Provide a detailed plan that will occur for testing and evaluation (to include data type, frequency, and structure).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integrate Phase II prototypes into deployed Naval vessels and transition finalized product to the Naval Surface Force (SUFOR). Plan for longitudinal evaluation of the Phase II prototype devices in an operational environment. This evaluation will consist of a cross comparison of the prototype function across two (or more) ships of different class and where appropriate include Marines and other service members embarked on warships (e.g., Destroyer vs. Amphibious Assault Ship) across the Operational Deployment Cycle/Optimized Fleet Response Plan Cycle. Outline the ability to mass produce, support, and service the developed wearable devices. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDual uses in the commercial sector include sporting teams, extreme athletes, and emergency services (Fire, EMS).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFried, Karl E. \u201cMilitary applications of soldier physiological monitoring.\u201d Jour of Sci and Med in Sport, 2018 Nov, 21(11), p.1147. \r\n\tStepheson, Mark et al. \u201cApplying Heart Rate Variability to Monitor Health and Performance in Tactical Personnel: A Narrative Review.\u201d Int J Environ Res Public Health, 2021 Jul 31, 18(15), p. 8143. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18158143 \r\n\tSaxon, Leslie et al. \u201cA Novel Digital Research Methodology for Continuous Health Assessment of the Special Operations Warfighter: The Digital cORA Study.\u201d J.

To enhance target detection and identification, the USN seeks to exploit the additional information content provided by polarization. Specifically, 3D polarization imaging has improved significantly in recent years as multiple strategies have been developed to resolve the polar and azimuthal angular ambiguities [Ref 1]. Measurement of polarization often provides increased discrimination of man-made objects from nature backgrounds, while the 3D variant could increase the likelihood of positive identification. Moreover, many new polarization-based techniques have been developed in recent years that could significantly increase performance over the conventional Stokes vector analysis, which alone often yields favorable results, but only for specific applications. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWithin the scope of this STTR topic, the USN seeks to develop a 3D polarization imaging system to significantly improve long-range detection and identification of targets in maritime clutter from surface-ship platforms. In principle, all wavelength bands from the UV to mm-wave will be considered, although transmission and depolarization with passage through the atmosphere in the maritime environment should be considered. Novel polarization techniques, such as point-spread-function engineering [Ref 2] or speckle correlation [Ref 3], which could potentially improve depth resolution or sampling rate, are also of interest. The use of multi-point correlation functions, such as the complex degree of mutual polarization [Ref 4] or other polarization correlation functions, would be of interest if these techniques can be used to enhance target identification or discrimination in clutter. In addition to the development of imager hardware, a processing component can be anticipated, which could exploit local measurements of the environment, such as ocean wave power spectra or the air-sea temperature jump, to enable optimization of data acquisition and interpretation [Ref 5].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a preliminary design of hardware and algorithms for a novel polarization-based imaging and sensing system that significantly exceeds the current state-of-the-art and enables improved detection and ID of small targets in a maritime environment at ranges beyond 1 km. Targets of shorter range are not of interest under this topic. Additionally, proposed solutions can explore polarization techniques combined with other techniques to further augment 3D image formation. The design should be supported by ample modelling and simulation results to justify construction in Phase II and by risk mitigation experiments as needed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a hardware/software realization of the design proposed under Phase I. Laboratory based testing should be completed under the Phase II effort to demonstrate the performance of the system.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Refine the design of improved ruggedness, size, weight, and power needs to broadly enable use of the system.

The primary goal of this STTR topic is to identify and explore advanced combustion technologies that will enable significant improvements in performance, fuel efficiency, operational capabilities, and integration with various fuel types, while maintaining or enhancing reliability, maintainability, and safety. The target application for this technology is gas turbine primary combustors, augmentors, rotating detonation combustors, and inter-turbine burners. A brief description of these devices is provided below:\r\n\r\n1. Primary Combustor: The primary combustor is where most of the combustion in a gas turbine occurs. Fuel is injected and ignited at high temperatures and pressures and the products drive the turbine stages of the engine.\r\n\r\n2. Augmentor: The augmentor, or afterburner, is used to significantly increase the thrust of military aircraft at the expense of fuel efficiency. Fuel is injected in the exhaust stream and ignited to accelerate the exhaust gas existing the engine. These types of combustors take up a significant amount of volume and weight on military aircraft.\r\n\r\n3. Rotating Detonation Combustors (RDCs): RDCs use a continuous detonation wave to burn a fuel-air mixture. The rotating detonation wave enables shorter combustion lengths and the device could theoretically produce a pressure rise, which is beneficial to the engine cycle. These type of devices are often difficult to operate and control.\r\n\r\n4. Inter-Turbine Burners (ITBs): In an ITB, fuel is added and combusted between stages of a multi-stage turbine to raise the enthalpy of the flowfield in a compact space. While not as efficient as a primary combustor, the ITB is useful for scenarios where additional thrust is needed (similar to the Augmentor). ITBs are challenging to design because of the aerodynamic and pressure changes caused by turbine stage rotation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTargeted and controllable combustion in naval aviation gas turbine engines is desirable since they provide thrust over a wide operational envelope for critical mission phases such as takeoff, supersonic cruise, and combat while being weight and volume constrained. Combustor length is typically constrained by the combined resonance time required to atomize, vaporize, mix, heat, and react liquid fuels with oxygen molecules at high flow rates, without blowing the flame out of the desired burn location.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA plasma assisted combustor uses plasma discharges to initiate and stabilize combustion, leading to more efficient fuel burning and improved combustion performance. This innovative technology can potentially lower the ignition temperature while enabling faster and more stable combustion. Additionally, electrically driven and controlled plasma may be used to actively control combustion properties. These improvements could yield significant benefits for naval aircraft including increased operational range, reduced fuel consumption, enhanced mission capabilities, and better component reliability. Specific goals for this effort include:\r\n\r\n1. Increased combustion efficiency: Achieve a significant improvement in combustion efficiency relative to traditional combustor designs.\r\n\r\n2. Decreased burning length: Decreasing the combustion resonance time will enable shorter combustor designs, which reduce the size and weight of the engine. \r\n\r\n3. Improved operational flexibility: Develop a PAC system that can adapt to various operating conditions and fuel types.\r\n\r\n4. Acceptable reliability and maintainability: Develop a PAC system that maintains or improves upon the reliability and maintainability of conventional systems, with a focus on minimizing downtime and maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n5. Scalable and ready for integration: Design a PAC system that can be readily integrated into future naval aircraft, with the ability to scale the technology for different engine sizes and configurations.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Office of Naval Research is specifically interested in liquid Jet fuel PAC solutions for this STTR topic, not gaseous. Although gaseous fuels may be used to minimize risk, they should not be the emphasis of this work.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct a comprehensive feasibility study and develop a conceptual design for the proposed PAC system. Thoroughly explore existing and emerging plasma assisted combustion technologies Assess their applicability to naval aircraft. The research and development efforts in Phase 1 should focus on the following key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Literature review and technology assessment: Perform a thorough review of the current state of the art in plasma assisted combustion, including research publications, patents, and ongoing research projects in both academia and industry. Identify and assess the most promising plasma generation methods, plasma-fuel interaction processes, and combustion enhancement techniques that have potential for integration into naval aircraft gas turbine engines\r\n\r\n2. Analysis of critical technical challenges: Identify the critical technical challenges associated with developing a PAC system for naval aviation gas turbine engines. These challenges may include, but are not limited to, plasma generation methods, plasma-fuel interaction, combustion stability, integration with engine components and systems, and the ability to adapt to various operating conditions and fuel types. Propose innovative solutions to address these challenges, and evaluate the feasibility of these solutions in the context of the overall PAC system design.\r\n\r\n3. Conceptual design: Develop a conceptual design for the liquid Jet fuel PAC system, incorporating the lessons learned from the literature review and technology assessment. The design should clearly illustrate the key components and subsystems of the PAC system, their function and operational requirements. Preliminary engine integration requirements and scaling constraints should also be identified.\r\n\r\n4. Preliminary benefits and cost assessment: Quantify the performance benefit and cost impact of using a PAC over existing combustor technology in a Navy-like engine. Among others, the analysis should consider factors such as combustion resonance time, combustion efficiency, operability envelope, fuel consumption, reliability, and maintainability. Please note that performers will need to use their own tools and cycle models to conduct these types of studies.\r\n\r\n5. Risk assessment and mitigation: Identify potential risks associated with the development testing, and implementation of the PAC system, including technical, operational, and programmatic risks. Develop a risk mitigation plan that outlines the strategies and measures that will be employed to address these risks throughout the course of the project. \r\n\r\n6. Development plan and schedule: Develop a detailed plan and schedule for the subsequent phases of the project, including Phase II (Prototype Development and Preliminary Testing) and Phase III (Full-Scale Testing and Validation). This plan should outline the specific tasks and milestones that will be completed in each phase, the resources and expertise that will be required, and the anticipated timeline for completion.\r\n\r\n7. Program cost analysis: Conduct a preliminary cost analysis for the development and testing of the PAC system, including estimates for research and development, prototyping, and testing costs. \r\n\r\n8. Close collaboration with original engine manufacturers is highly encouraged starting in Phase I.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of Phase I, the resulting feasibility study and conceptual design will serve as the foundation for the subsequent phases of the project, providing a clear roadmap for the development and testing of the PAC system in naval aircraft gas turbine engines.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype PAC system based on the conceptual design from Phase I and conduct preliminary testing to assess its performance, efficiency, and adaptability to various operating conditions and fuel types. Perform design refinement, testing, and optimization, with the goal of addressing the critical technical challenges identified in Phase I and demonstrating the potential operational improvements and benefits of the PAC system. The research and development efforts in Phase II should focus on the following key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Detailed design and component selection: Develop a detailed design for the liquid jet fuel PAC system, including the selection of appropriate materials, components, and subsystems that meet the requirements for each test. This design process should involve a thorough evaluation of various plasma generation techniques, plasma-fuel interaction strategies, and combustion enhancement approaches, with the goal of selecting the most promising and feasible options for a Navy PAC system.\r\n\r\n2. Prototype fabrication: Fabricate a prototype PAC system based on the detailed design, using advanced manufacturing techniques and materials, as required. Performers are expected to collaborate with engine manufacturers, materials suppliers, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure relevance and facilitate technology transition.\r\n\r\n3. Preliminary bench-scale testing: Conduct preliminary bench-scale testing of the prototype PAC system using liquid jet fuels to assess its performance, efficiency, and adaptability to various operating conditions and fuel types. \r\n\r\n4. Data analysis and design optimization: Analyze the data collected during the preliminary bench-scale testing to identify any areas of the prototype\u2019s design that required refinement or optimization. This analysis should involve a thorough evaluation of the PAC system\u2019s performance, efficiency, and adaptability, as well as its overall impact on engine operation, maintenance, and safety. Based on this analysis, refine and optimize the design of the PAC system to address any identified issues and maximize its potential benefits for naval aircraft gas turbine engines. \r\n\r\n5. Updated risk assessment and mitigation: Revisit the risk assessment and mitigation plan developed in Phase I, and update it based on the results of the prototype development and preliminary testing. This update should include any new risk mitigation strategies and measures that have been employed during the course of Phase II.\r\n\r\n6. Phase III planning: Develop a detailed plan for Phase III (Full-Scale Testing and Validation), outlining the specific tasks, milestones, and resources that will be required to conduct full-scale testing of the optimized PAC system, validate its performance and efficiency improvements, and develop a plan for integrating the system into future naval aircraft gas turbine engines. \r\n\r\nUpon completion of Phase II, the resulting optimized prototype PAC system will serve as the basis for the subsequent Phase III, demonstrating the potential benefits and feasibility of implementing this advanced combustion technology in naval aircraft gas turbine engines.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Conduct full-scale testing of the optimized PAC system in a relevant engine environment, validating its performance, efficiency, and operability improvements. The research and development efforts in Phase III should focus on the following key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Full-scale testing: Conduct full-scale testing of the optimized liquid jet fuel PAC system in a representative engine environment, evaluating its performance under different operating conditions and using various fuel types. \r\n\r\n2. Performance validation: Validate the performance, efficiency, and operational improvements achieved by the PAC system through rigorous data analysis. Compare the results with traditional combustor designs to better quantify the benefits and drawbacks of the new technology. Evaluate the PAC system\u2019s capability to meet the predefined goals and requirements established during Phase I and Phase II. \r\n\r\nUpon completion of Phase III, the resulting validated PAC system will be ready for detailed engine integration studies and manufacturing readiness level maturation. Ideally, this effort will result in significant combustion performance and operability improvements over the state of the art.\r\n\r\nImprovements in combustion efficiency, fuel consumption, and operational flexibility make it an attractive solution for commercial aviation. In commercial aviation, fuel efficiency is a critical concern for airlines. Implementing PAC technology in aircraft engines could significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions, leading to substantial cost savings for airlines and reduced environmental impact. Furthermore, enhanced combustion efficiency and operability could enable the use of alternative and sustainable fuels, supporting the aviation industry\u2019s ongoing effort to transition towards more environmentally friendly energy sources. PAC could also improve ground based power generation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStarikovskaia, S.

It is common for these seabed environments to prove difficult for sensors to penetrate for a full understanding of the bathymetry and shallow water regime. The ability to utilize a system which, when deployed by a diver, or from an autonomous vehicle, can work within and on the seabed, penetrating the sediment to help expeditionary users better understand the bottom habitat. This STTR topic seeks to develop a soft robot capable of untethered, autonomous locomotion within granular media in shallow sea-floor environments. The robot should be able to operate with an onboard power source and control system that can permit up to 2 hours of movement and 72 hours of stationary sensing. The robot should be capable of movement within submerged sand up to a depth within 1 meters of the sand surface, and horizontal movement up to 10 meters, on a single battery charge.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA proposed operational task for such robots would be surveying underwater soil regions by following movement trajectories that are pre-defined (e.g., a grid trajectory), or sensory feedback determined (e.g., follow path of low soil resistance). This task requires the ability to move in multiple directions and to incorporate sensor feedback into basic control algorithms for robot movement. The specific military impact will be to enable the detection, characterization and possibly neutralization of buried mines on the seafloor, and locate attached buried wires, although these would not be the specific tasks within this STTR topic. There would also be future opportunities for seabed sensing, communication, and ISR roles.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct a study on the feasibility of a biologically inspired power-autonomous vehicle design, with a focus on mobility mechanism and power source. This should draw on prior biological research on subterranean locomotion kinematics, dynamics, and granular-body interactions. Identify the most promising actuation mechanism, including power requirements and expected lifetime. Conduct a design study of the feasibility of different sustainable power sources (e.g., solar, mechanical energy scavenging, microbial fuel cells) and specify the expected mission duration.

Develop a Phase II plan.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Fully develop and fabricate a prototype, according to the requirements stated in the Description. Evaluate the design via in-water tests conducted in a realistic submerged soil environment, targeting the listed performance objectives, including vertical and horizontal digging range and stiffness gradient sensing, via untethered operations. At a minimum, the prototype testing shall consist of (1) basic operability testing, (2) grid survey, (3) range/endurance trials, and (4) object detection. The awardee may propose other tests needed to demonstrate the benefits of their design perform analyses to establish reliability, identify areas needing further improvement, if necessary, and analyze manufacturing scalability in order to transition the design into a useful product for the Navy.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Apply the knowledge gained in Phase II to build a prototype ready for field testing.

Explosive charges, such as the SUS source, are especially convenient for being compact and mobile for easy deployment by surface or airborne platforms. SUS is routinely used to conduct transmission loss experiments used to determine bottom loss parameters which are used in databases for seabed bottom properties. A typical SUS charge contains the chemical compound trinitrotoluene, TNT; a chemical compound used as an explosive material requiring special handling. However, it\u2019s been shown that impulsive sound sources, such as created by the implosion of lightbulbs, can be useful for transmission loss or seabed characterization experiments. This STTR topic seeks development of an impulsive sound source without explosives or combustible gas packaged in A-size sonobuoy and/or SUS form factor.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop an impulsive underwater acoustic source concept that does not explosives or combustible gas. The source shall exhibit a Peak Source Level greater than or equal to 190 dB//1\u00b5Pa@1m at water depths of 10 \u2013 200 m or deeper.

Demonstrate that the impulsive source signature is repeatable and predictable for a given source depth. Develop a capability for triggering the source at a specific depth over the range specified. Develop a plan in consultation with the Navy for demonstrating the source to include compliance with environmental regulations. After demonstrations, develop a design for an expendable version of the source with form factors compatible with A-size sonobuoy and SUS.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The expected transition will be an inert impulsive expendable underwater acoustic source that can be used for transmission loss surveys, geotechnical surveys, and other naval or civil applications. The inert nature of the source will make handling much safer than currently used sources. Phase III tasking shall include refining the prototype design and fabrication of a near-final product suitable for testing. Sufficient test articles should be manufactured to establish repeatability of the specified source characteristics. An at-sea experimental test and evaluation plan shall be developed and executed in consultation with the sponsor. Test articles meeting the SUS form factor can be demonstrated by being deployed by hand or with the use of a suitable launcher from the deck of a ship. Test articles meeting the A-size sonobuoy form factor must demonstrate compatibility with standard launch tubes with a test plan developed in consultation with the platform operator. In their final forms, the SUS form factor is expected to be used for operational surveys or in support of basic and applied research.

The technology is needed to reconstruct attack stories, distilling the most important related events from vast quantities of low-level system and network data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: As cyber attacks continue to escalate in complexity and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors shift to using low-and-slow multi-stage attacks, cyber intrusion detection has come to be treated as a Big Data problem. Modern approaches require that a wide variety of information and sensor streams come together in an integrated analysis environment, with human and machine analytics combing the data feeds, hunting for needles in the haystack.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, in connectivity-disadvantaged tactical environments, all of the fine-grained cyber event data (interface calls, low-level system logs, packet captures, event attestation, etc.) generated by a platform\u2019s information systems is unable to be streamed back to a centralized repository in a timely manner. This results in limitations for cyber attack investigations: either central analysis relies on incomplete, untimely, or reduced-precision data, or analytics expecting a global picture have to be pushed out to edge nodes, simultaneously reducing their effectiveness and separating them from the cyber hunt experts best equipped to make use of them.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo better address the problem of conducting effective Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) on systems where connectivity is Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, or Limited (DDIL), new technology is needed to enable a multi-stage forensics approach to cyber event analysis and investigation. To feed later stages of analysis, portable analytics designed to be edge deployed need to be developed that distill the rich, onboard system and network event data, enabling the platform to make the most efficient use of any upstream connection.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe analytics must not rely on having any backhaul connectivity or onboard operator expertise beyond a most basic set of hints such as an operator noticing that a service crashed or that a subsystem was behaving oddly. The analytics should seek out connections and sequences in the system and network data that map to possible attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), then bundle relevant data for priority offboarding to a more centralized analysis platform where it could be further triaged.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept for automated rapid cyber forensics that can enable multi-stage cyber attack investigation and meet the constraints outlined in the Description.

At this high altitude, the naturally occurring alkali atoms are at low pressure making the environment similar to atomic measurements inside of traditional vapor cells. As in conventional atomic magnetometers [Refs 3,4,5], first pumping with circularly polarized light depopulates all but one hyperfine sublevel of the ground state creating a net polarization. Next, the polarized spins precess at the Larmor frequency that is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. The constant of proportionality is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is a known atomic physics constant for a specific atomic isotope. Finally, the atoms fluoresce producing a readout signal. \r\n\r\nThis STTR topic seeks to demonstrate atomic magnetometry with atoms in the air at sea level. Historic work has identified 129Xenon as a naturally occurring species in air with a long nuclear spin lifetime that could be used for magnetometry [Ref 6]. Like other species in the air, the transition energy to the first excited state in xenon is a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) transition [Refs 7,8,9] but commercially available ultrashort pulse lasers can generate intensities above 1 GW/cm^2 for efficient multi-photon excitation using visible blue light. While the ~100 picosecond time between collisions in air is too short for fluorescence and the xenon concentration is too low for stimulated emission, recent work has used ultrashort pulse lasers to demonstrate Resonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) in air. Thomson scattering of radar off the resulting low-density plasma (i.e., radar REMPI) could remotely readout the ionized electrons for a standoff magnetometry signal [Refs 10,11]. In this method, the laser wavelength provides the selectivity, and the radar intensity determines the sensitivity. Initial proposals should present a specific plan for reading the spin of a hyperfine 129Xe ground state, including the planned energy levels that will be utilized for three-photon radar REMPI.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Demonstrate radar REMPI detection of 129Xe using three-photon excitation in a vapor cell, ideally down to a pressure of 1e11 atoms/cc or show how this sensitivity could be achieved. Assess the time for spin to transfer from an excited electron to the nuclear spin during REMPI readout. Present a plan to demonstrate an all-optical standoff magnetometry measurement in a vapor cell including optical polarization and radar REMPI readout of the 129Xe.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Demonstrate remote magnetometry using radar REMPI readout with 129Xe in a vapor cell [Ref 12]. Publish a journal article ideally demonstrating the measurement in air (with the naturally occurring 129Xe concentration at 23 ppb) or clearly present how a measurement in air could be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Explore methods to improve the measurement sensitivity, study schemes to increase the pumping efficiency and polarization with pressure broadened lines at atmospheric pressure, theoretically understand the spin transfer time relative to quenching from collisions, and advance methods to decrease the laser energy requirements. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications include trace gas detection for air quality monitoring, combustion characterization, and magnetic mapping for geophysical prospecting.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKane et al. \u201cLaser Remote Magnetometry Using Mesospheric Sodium.\u201d JGR Space Physics 123, 8, 2018.\r\n\tBustos et al. \u201cRemote sensing of geomagnetic fields and atomic collisions in the mesosphere,\u201d Nature Communications 9, 3981, 2018.\r\n\tSheng et al. \u201cSubfemtotesla Scalar Atomic Magnetometry Using Multipass Cells.,\u201d PRL 110, 160802, 2013. \r\n\tPatton, B. et al. \u201cA remotely interrogated all-optical 87Rb magnetometer.\u201d APL 101, 083502. 2012. \r\n\tDegenkolb, Skyler M. \u201cOptical Magnetometry Using Multiphoton Transitions.\u201d University of Michigan Dissertation 2016. https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/135807\r\n\tHapper, William. \u201cLaser Remote Sensing of Magnetic Fields in the Atmosphere by Two-Photon Optical Pumping of Xe129.\u201d (1978), https://physics.princeton.edu/atomic/happer/Publications.html\r\n\tSaloman, E.B. \u201cEnergy Levels and Observed Spectral Lines of Xenon, Xe I through Xe LIV.\u201d Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data 33, 765. 2004. \r\n\tD\u2019Amico, G. et al. \u201cIsotope-shift and hyperfine-constant measurements of near-infrared xenon transitions in glow discharges and on a metastable Xe(3P2) beam.\u201d PRA 60, 6, 1999. \r\n\tG.

Friction stir deposition systems are able to deposit high-quality aluminum, titanium and high-strength steel alloys, but current commercial systems as supplied by manufacturers like MELD and BOND use tool heads with a large surface area, approximately 1-1.25\u201d in diameter [Ref 1]. This scale is useful for larger volume material deposition but is too large for the repair of most components on Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, which have small, localized damage areas of < 1\u201d. In addition, this large tool geometry requires large backing forces to support a repair, which is likely going to be excessive for thin cross-section aircraft parts, potentially leading to part deformation during deposition [Ref 2].

In almost all cases, it is desired to wrap these structures over the complex and irregular surfaces of these air-vehicle platforms. However, conforming planar periodic structures over doubly-curved and irregular surfaces causes the planar periodic electromagnetic structures unit cells to become deformed, which alters their electromagnetic properties in an undesirable way.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of this topic is to develop a general-purpose software tool that can wrap any planar periodic structure over any surface while minimizing or eliminating any of the unit cells from being deformed. The tool shall use solid models as inputs and outputs to maximize compatibility with other software.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Future warfighting includes an incredibly complex, contested, and often hostile electromagnetic spectrum environment through which our airborne platforms will operate. Planar periodic structures can be employed to manipulate electromagnetic interactions with the surface of a vehicle.\u00a0 To utilize / cover the full surface area of a platform without any gaps, it is desired to wrap the periodic structures over irregular and doubly-curved surfaces [1]. Unfortunately, doing this also deforms the unit cells of the periodic structures, which alters their electromagnetic properties.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn recent years, several algorithms have been demonstrated with the ability to bend, twist, conform and otherwise spatially vary periodic structures in a special way that minimizes unintended deformations to the unit cells [1,2]. These algorithms have been used to wrap frequency preferred surfaces over doubly-curved surfaces while preserving the electromagnetic performance of the unit cells [1]. Such periodic structures can be called preservational spatially-variant lattices (PSVLs).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is desired to create a general purpose software tool that can wrap any planar periodic structure over the surface of any object in a way that preserves the size, shape and spacing of the unit cells, all using solid modeling. Meshes are highly problematic because they can contain many errors, such as being non-manifold (e.g. not air tight), and they are less compatible with commercial CAD and simulation software. The inputs and outputs of the Phase II software tool shall be solid models to maximize compatibility with other software and avoid errors that arise when manipulating meshes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: In Phase 1, the performer shall conceptualize a software tool that offers a user the capability to wrap any planar periodic structure over any surface as a PSVL. The software tool shall take as inputs solid models of the unit cell and the surface over which to generate the PSVL.\u00a0 The performer shall lay out a software tool development strategy for implementation during the Phase II effort.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The Phase II effort shall develop and demonstrate a software tool that offers a user the capability to wrap any planar periodic structure over any surface as a PSVL. The software tool shall take as inputs solid models of the unit cell and the surface over which to generate the PSVL. The software tool shall export a solid model of the PSVL that can be directly and easily imported into manufacturing and simulation software. Any proposals using meshes as inputs or outputs will not be considered for funding. The Phase II software shall provide a modern user interface.\u00a0 The performer shall address how the PSVL software could be parallelized for computationally intensive jobs, operated in secure cloud environments suitable for DOD and defense contractors, and connected to manufacturing software during a Phase III effort.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Operating air platforms through complicated and hostile electromagnetic environments is a high priority for the Air Force.

The device should be packaged in a standard enclosure such as a butterfly package with all electrical connections made, and fiber-coupled with at least 40 milliwatts out of a polarization-maintaining fiber.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Atomic clocks have seen a revolution in technology over the past decade as they have pushed towards chip-scale sizes, allowing them to be used in communications, navigation, and other defense-related technologies [1]. Future technologies such as clocks for \"5G\" networks and future Global Navigation Satellite System architectures could potentially incorporate more advanced clocks. Optical clocks such as the rubidium two-photon clock offers potential improvements over current chip scale clocks and surpass rubidium atomic frequency references [2]. One limiting factor in future, more advanced optical clocks is the development of the needed laser technology. Optical clocks require narrow linewidths down to kHz linewidths for the rubidium two photon optical clock, or even more narrow for other optical clocks such as strontium. These devices must be optically isolated to ensure the narrow linewidth and to avoid reflections causing unwanted lasing modes. Current systems typically employ a series of free space or fiber coupled components to achieve narrow linewidths and high optical power [2], but they can be susceptible to vibrations and shock. Furthermore, these systems typically have optical isolators with large magnetic fields, limiting the compactness of the device due to the effect of the magnetic field on the atoms.\u00a0 Recently, there have been advancements in each individual area such as narrow linewidth lasers [3, 4], on-chip non-magnetic isolators [5, 6], and new integration techniques [7]. The creation of such a device will not only enhance the manufacturability of the clock and lower the overall size, weight, and power, but it will also increase the environmental robustness to effects such as shock and vibration [8]. However, these devices have not been integrated into a single photonically integrated package. The DoD seeks the development of a photonically integrated circuit that includes a narrow linewidth laser and an on-chip non-magnetic optical isolator in a single package to serve the needs for next generation optical clocks.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Initial design and simulation of a sub-10 kilohertz linewidth laser at 778.1 nanometers, specifically the rubidium two-photon transition frequency, as well as a non-magnetic or minimally magnetic on-chip optical isolator with greater than 30 decibels of isolation and a fiber-coupled output greater than 40 milliwatts. Also a method for integrating the devices into a single package, either heterogeneous or hybrid integration, that allows for mass fabrication, ideally at the foundry level.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Packaged device with a sub-10 kilohertz linewidth laser at 778.1 nanometers, specifically the rubidium two-photon transition frequency, integrated with a non-magnetic or minimally magnetic on-chip isolator that provides at least 30 decibels of isolation, and fiber coupled. The means of integration should allow for mass fabrication, ideally at a foundry level. It should provide at least 40 milliwatts out of a polarization-maintaining fiber with greater than 25 decibels polarization extinction ratio.\u00a0 The packaging should contain all electrical connections and thermal control, and be mounted in a standard style enclosure, such as a butterfly package, with a polarization maintaining fiber out. At least 2 prototypes are expected to be delivered.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: These devices will be extremely useful for a variety of applications such as next generation optical and atomic clocks, but will require further testing for shock and vibration, acceleration sensitivity, radiation tolerance, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKitching, J., Chip-scale atomic devices, Appl.

Also no mathematical symbols.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo design and fabricate a multiplexing multispectral filter array covering the visible wavelengths that\r\n\r\nachieves a higher optical throughput than a narrowband array with equivalent bandwidth and\r\n\r\nspectral resolution.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent visible-wavelength multispectral filter array technologies suffer from low light throughput because every pixel on the sensor only measures a single wavelength at a single spatial location. Multiple pixels are then considered together to construct the spectral signature over that group of pixels. This approach, while intuitive, leads to low light levels as the spectral resolution increases, since each pixel sees an ever-smaller piece of the object spectrum. The result of this is that high spectral resolution hyperspectral video becomes difficult due to the high integration times necessary to measure the signal. To resolve this issue, the performer will design and fabricate a visible-wavelength multiplexing multispectral filter array, where each filter is sensitive to many wavelengths at once. The performer will then mount their fabricated array onto an off-the-shelf monochromatic camera and demonstrate scene sampling and demosaicking. Success will be defined by the SNR, integration time, and spectral resolution and bandwidth compared to those of an off-the-shelf narrowband multispectral filter array.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Modeling and simulation will be performed to determine a recipe for depositing a multiplexing filter array onto glass. The simulated filter transmission spectra will be used to model the sampling and demosaicking of a standard hyperspectral test image. Facilities for filter array fabrication will be identified by the performer.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The multispectral filter array will be fabricated using the facilities identified by the performer during the Phase I. The performer will then characterize the array and align and mount it to a calibrated sensor. Hyperspectral measurements will then be acquired by the camera, demosaicked to recover the hyperspectral datacube, and then compared to imagery of the same scene acquired with an off-the-shelf pushbroom hyperspectral camera. The Phase II deliverable will be the fabricated filter array attached to the provided sensor.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The spatial and spectral resolution of a camera with the affixed filter array will be characterized. A mounting system will be built for the camera to allow it to be attached to an off-the-shelf drone. A field test will be performed in which hyperspectral video of multiple moving ground targets with diverse spectral content will be acquired from a drone.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHarwitt, M. and Sloane, N., \"Hadamard Transform Optics,\" Academic Press, 1979;\r\n\tOliver, J. et al., \u201cFilters with random transmittance for improving resolution in filter-array-based spectrometers,\u201d Opt.

beam sources with a high-brightness atomic flux density (greater than 10^10 atoms/second per 10,000 micrometer-squared cross sectional area) with a minimum total flux greater than 10^10 atoms/second and suitable for atomic sensing, atomic clocks, or other quantum devices of interest to the Department of Defense.\u00a0 The atom source should be compatible with mass-production techniques with preference being given to devices that can be integrated with established chip-alignment processes and procedures.\u00a0 The atomic sources should focus on simplicity and should use either no lasers or very simple laser configurations.\u00a0 The width of the transverse velocity distribution of the atoms emitting from the source should be no greater than 5 meters/second.\u00a0 Atomic beam sources developed under this topic should achieve the aggressive flux and velocity metrics within a total volume of 250 microliters with a viable path to achieve all metrics within a total device volume of 100 microliters.\u00a0 Preference will be given to sources that are able to reduce and control the longitudinal velocity as well as the transverse velocity.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Atom-based sensors and clocks have shown tremendous promise in laboratory based experiments.\u00a0 In addition, atom-based quantum information processing nodes are likely to be necessary for short term quantum memory storage and transduction between different quantum systems.\u00a0 For clocks and sensors, the signal to noise ratio is typically improved in these devices by using laser cooling to produce a narrow velocity distribution that is within the Doppler width of the atoms or the linewidth of the laser.\u00a0 Using lasers for cooling is a well established technique but often increases the size and complexity of the device due to optical constraints.\u00a0 Several types of past and present atomic devices have avoided laser complexity by using filtered thermal atomic beams as the basis of atomic clocks and inertial sensors.\u00a0 For future atomic sensors that have low size, weight, and power (SWaP) that maintain high performance there needs to be a low-complexity, very compact atomic source with a well defined and narrow velocity range that uses no lasers, or greatly reduced laser paths, to produce a high brightness atomic flux.\u00a0 Ideally, this device will be suited for scalable manufacturing or fabrication techniques and could be compatible to integrate with established chip alignment processes.\u00a0 The device should produce greater than 10^10 atoms/second with a transverse velocity width less than 5 meters/second.\u00a0 The total size should 100 microliters including heaters and vacuum enclosure.\u00a0 Preference will be given to sources that are able to control the longitudinal velocity as well as the transverse velocity.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop necessary plans and concepts to create a high-flux atomic source suitable for atomic sensing, atomic clocks, or other quantum devices while meeting performance metrics highlighted in the objectives of this topic.\u00a0 The designs and concepts should clearly identify how the required performance metrics will be met while simultaneously meeting the required Size, Weight and Power metrics.\u00a0 The plans and concepts should include a clear and convincing pathway towards low-cost, scalable production.\u00a0 This plans should also conceptualize how the atomic source designs could provide advantage over state of the art for a relevant atomic device, such as an atomic inertial sensor, compact atomic clock, or other quantum information processing device.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Instantiate and demonstrate a functioning prototype meeting the required specifications as described in the topic objectives and as represented by finalized plans and concepts initially developed in Phase I.\u00a0 Perform experiments and analyze results to establish the performance of the device and compare versus the desired topic objectives and demonstrate the adequacy of the device concepts.\u00a0 Demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, scalable production of the high-flux atom devices still capable of achieving all performance specs identified in the objectives.\u00a0 Develop contacts with potential customers and develop a transition plan supporting future Phase III activity.\u00a0 Provide regular communication to the government sponsor to demonstrate progress and to ensure government understanding of risk mitigation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Mature the prototype technologies developed in Phase II to include ease of integration into full quantum devices.\u00a0 It is anticipated that the devices developed under this effort would be geared towards integration into low Size, Weight, and Power thermal-beam sensors, such as those being developed by the Defense Innovation Unit and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E).\u00a0 Phase III efforts should focus on integration into full-quantum systems with prospective transition partners.\u00a0 The contractor will transition the

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThere are few commercially available, monolithic, SDR-SoCs on the market [1][2], and those that exist, though highly capable, can be cost prohibitive and are not optimized for low size, weight, and power (SWaP) DoD applications, such as small handheld devices where ultra-low power and reduced form-factor are major design considerations. Furthermore, a review of prior awarded SBIR/STTR topics demonstrates that defense specific needs for low SWaP SDR devices have routinely been met through a modular approach of integrating commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) devices [3]. However, further SWaP optimization can only be achieved through higher levels of SoC integration with efficient architecture execution in supportive modern semiconductor technologies that include sufficient intellectual property (IP) offerings. Though SDR construction varies, the typical SDR architecture consists of a RF frontend, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for baseband signal processing, and microprocessor or microcontroller for SDR control and power management. While continued advances in analog-to-digital (ADC) converter and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) designs have fueled RF SoC frontend innovations, such as direct-sampling of RF signals [4][5], and with the availability of processor core IP more commonplace in modern technology nodes, FPGA fabrics may not be most effective for on-chip baseband signal processing. While FPGAs are capable of meeting the high performance and reconfigurability requirements of SDRs, this comes at the expense of area and power dissipation due to their inherent structure. Furthermore, the powerup and reconfiguration latencies of FPGAs can be an issue in applications where wakeup time and agile tuning are required. To address these issues, taking advantage of advances in semiconductor scaling, application specific baseband processing, typically accomplished by the FPGA, may be more efficiently accomplished through on chip digital signal processing (DSP) techniques.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phase I effort is to: determine the feasibility (cost, schedule, and performance) related to the development of the SDR-SoC; identify technological issues (availability of IP, etc.) to be addressed through innovations; and, develop a Phase II proposal for development activities toward the realization of the SDR-SoC from design to qualification, with the goal of meeting the following performance specifications:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n\r\na.\u2003Off-state leakage current: < 10 \u00b5A\r\n\r\nb.\u2003Sleep conditions must be specified along with projected sleep current.\r\n\r\nc.\u2003Active power management with ability to shutdown/sleep system components.\r\n\r\nd.\u2003Peak Power Dissipation: < 1 W\r\n\r\ne.\u2003Chip area: 5mm x 5mm\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRF Frontend:\r\n\r\na.\u2003Transceiver tuning range: 100 MHz to 6 GHz\r\n\r\nb.\u2003At least 1 Tx and 1 Rx channel\r\n\r\nc.\u200340MHz Bandwidth\r\n\r\nd.\u2003Anti-aliasing filters\r\n\r\ne.\u200314 bit DAC, 14 bit ADC or better\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDSP Engine\r\n\r\na.\u2003Programmable DSP module floating point, 64 MACs running at 500MHz or better.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nProcessor Core: \r\n\r\na.\u2003ARM Cortex9 or better or RISC-V core with support for bootable Linux OS, external storage, UART, USB, I2C, SPI, network interfaces.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, due to national security considerations use of the Trusted Foundry Program, foundry access (GLOBALFOUNDRIES) is preferred, but not required, when considering feasibility options. Phase-I feasibility study should also be inclusive of programming software for the DSP module and front end, and supported Linux distribution(s).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Phase II effort is to: execute on the Phase I proposed developmental activities and innovations needed to advance the SDR-SoC concept; demonstrate working silicon; and develop a Phase III product commercialization plan, including potential non-DoD customers. Phase II outcomes will result in the design for fabrication, fabrication, package, assembly, test, qualification, and delivery of functional prototypes, including supporting design development and user-required software, data, and documentation, of either the fully functional monolithic SDR-SoC or necessary IP block(s) required to advance the monolithic SDR-SoC concept.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:\r\n\r\nThe objective of Phase III effort is to pursue commercialization objectives resulting from the Phase II developments.

The design must protect the current CV Boots, replace the Boot with a more durable material, or redesign the wheel end drive joint so that it does not require a grease filled boot covered joint. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nProposed concepts should:\r\n\r\n- Address the ability to function in extreme operating environments which include but are not limited to -40 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) to +120\u00b0F, hot desert blowing sand, full salt water immersion, operation to and from the beach in surf zones up to 6 foot Significant Breaker Height (SBH) and mud (soft soil of 30 Rating Cone Index (RCI)) which includes suspended abrasive items such as rocks, gravel, sand, and coral.\r\n\r\n- Allow for terrain traverse with combined 3 g-force (G) vertical and 0.7 G horizontal load on suspension station, racking load at diagonal corners for 1 G vertical load, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) tree impact (5\" tree at 32 kilometers per hour (kph)-8365 pound equivalent static load), and fatigue loads for 30 year vehicle life.\r\n\r\n- Allow for a maximum of 4,350 newton-meters (NM) of torque, a maximum angle of 40 degrees (short duration), and a maximum rotation speed of 2,682 RPM.\r\n\r\n- Support steering in the forward and reverse directions on 40% side slopes and ascending, descending, starting, and stopping on a dry hard surfaced longitudinal slope up to and including 60% grade in both forward and reverse direction.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design a more durable wheel end drive in consideration of the operating environment in which the drive system will be exposed. Demonstrate, via modeling or testing, the feasibility of the concept(s) in meeting Marine Corps\u2019 needs and establish that the concept can be developed into a useful product for the Marine Corps. Feasibility will be established by material testing and analytical modeling as appropriate. Provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals and key technical milestones that will address technical risk reduction.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a scaled prototype for evaluation. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals established for the Marine Corps\u2019 amphibious vehicles. System performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation and modeling or analytical methods over the required range of parameters. Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into a design that will meet Marine Corps requirements. Working with the Marine Corps, prepare a Phase III development plan to detail the strategy for transitioning the technology for Marine Corps use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Marine Corps in transitioning the durable wheel end drive system for Marine Corps use. Working with the Marine Corps, integrate the prototype wheel end drive system into a vehicle for evaluation to determine its effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment. Provide support to the Marine Corps during test and validation to certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use. Develop manufacturing plans and capabilities to produce the system for both military and commercial markets. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis technology is directly applicable to large military vehicles such as the Marine Corps ACV. \r\n\r\nSuccessful development and characterization of a durable wheel end drive system has direct application to various military and commercial applications such as amphibious rescue vehicles. Reductions of weight and complexity in the suspension can be of substantial value.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMIL-STD-810G Environmental Test Methods and Engineering Guidelines. http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-810_13751/\r\n\tMIL-STD-889B Dissimilar Metals.http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL_STD_889B_955/\r\n\tDescription of a flex joint/Giubo. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giubo\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Provide a minimum of six key words separated by semicolons.

capability development and Operational Plan assessment wargames. The prototype would provide medical treatment simulation from time of injury to return to combat effectiveness via the various echelons of care.\r\n\r\nSome examples under the above headings include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Establish baseline performance characteristics of existing medical support systems under a given scenario.\r\n\r\n- Model novel ways of treating/transporting/managing Marine casualties occurring in austere environments within challenging operating environments, with imposed limitations on naval medical support.\r\n\r\n- Model the complex relationships between location and type of injury, types of medical transport available, location and capabilities of the various echelons of care available, eventual return to combat effectiveness, and associated critical time and resource metrics.\r\n\r\nFull satisfaction of each conceptual model requirement is the end goal, however partial solutions will be considered. This topic specifically focuses on developing the mathematical, algorithmic, and data aspects of the conceptual models. The mechanism by which these conceptual models would be integrated with existing wargaming kinetic models resident within the NWAC is not the focus. Documentation of the conceptual models with Cameo Systems Modeler (Cameo/SysML) is desirable, but not necessarily a strict requirement, if another representation is more suitable [Ref 2].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop concepts for an improved representation of medical echelon of care in wargaming M&S that meets the requirements described above. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concepts in meeting Marine Corps needs and establish that the concepts can be developed into a useful product for the Marine Corps. Feasibility will be established by evaluation of the plan of attack for the development effort including data availability. Provide a Phase II development plan with performance goals and key technical milestones, and that addresses technical risk reduction.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop prototype conceptual models. The prototype will be evaluated to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II development plan and the Marine Corps requirements for medical echelon of care M&S. System performance will be demonstrated through prototype evaluation over the required range of parameters. Evaluation results will be used to refine the prototype into an initial design that will meet Marine Corps requirements. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Marine Corps use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Marine Corps in transitioning the technology for Marine Corps use. Develop medical echelon of care conceptual models for evaluation to determine effectiveness in an operationally relevant environment within the NWAC. Support the Marine Corps for M&S Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) to certify and qualify the system for Marine Corps use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe conceptual models described herein are not only a high priority within the Marine Corps [Refs 1, 3], but are equally applicable across the Services, to support not only wargaming, but also analysis, training, and experimentation. Successfully developed conceptual models would likely be of great interest across these communities. DoD components and prime contractors are in need of accurate medical casualty/echelon of care simulation representation to support gap analysis and solution assessment. Potential civilian applications include emergency medicine and care after the emergency room.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\u201cCommandant\u2019s Planning Guidance.\u201d 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps, 2019. http://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Publications/Commandant&#39;s%20Planning%20Guidance_2019.pdf?ver=2019-07-17-090732-937 \r\n\t\u201cIEEE Recommended Practice for Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP)\u201d, IEEE Standard 1730-2022, https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1730/10715/\r\n\t\u201cForce Design 2030 Annual Update, June 2023. 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps. https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Docs/Force_Design_2030_Annual_Update_June_2023.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: MCWAC; NWAC; USMC; M&S; Modeling and Simulation; medical; conceptual model; analysis; Neller Center; wargaming; Force Design;\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479679","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Lower-Cost Textiles for Dismounted Signature Management","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-003","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

This effort shall apply the developed concept(s) to a Flame Retardant (FR) textile. The textile/material solution(s) developed in this effort are intended to be used in a tactical environment to reduce individual dismounted Marine signature, applicable to a suite of items, in the Infrared Spectrum (IR) from Near Infrared (NIR) through to Long Wave Infrared (LWIR). The intent of this capability is to degrade the ability of adversaries to detect, identify, and recognize a Marine, increasing Marine lethality and survivability in a sensor contested environment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Detection, recognition, identification, and targeting of dismounted warfighters is a critical variable in past and future fights. Currently dismounted infantry and infantry-like Marines are at an increased risk from various IR imagers from the ground and air. Publicly accessible information and videos on recent events (i.e., the Ukraine-Russia conflict) have demonstrated how accessible and proliferated a variety of sensors are due to recent technological advancements in detector technology. The 2016 Marine Corps Operating Concept cites a \u2018\u201cBattle of signatures\u201d where \u201cTomorrow\u2019s fights will involve conditions in which \u201cto be detected is to be targeted is to be killed.\u201d Adversaries will routinely net together sensors, spies, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and space imagery to form sophisticated \u201cISR-strike systems\u201d that are able to locate, track, target, and attack an opposing force\u2026 No matter the means of detection, unmanaged signatures will increasingly become a critical vulnerability\u2026 Defensively, our units will need to adapt how they fight, emphasizing emissions control and other means of signature management to increase their survivability.\u201d [Ref 4] \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe current combat ensemble provides visual (VIS) and Near Infrared (NIR) signature mitigation. Current VIS is provided in MARPAT with a digital pattern breakup by utilizing four (4) distinct colors in two (2) color-way patterns, Woodland and Desert, for use in their respective environments. NIR signature management (typically defined as 700-1,000 nanometers) is achieved through the camouflage pattern, breakup, and pigments of the dyestuffs. Near-term improvements and updates to military textiles with Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) (most typically defined as 1,000-1,700 nanometers with some emerging devices seen in the upper ranges of 1,700-2,500 nanometers) mitigation through adjustments in dyestuffs are being evaluated for adoption; these values are ITAR restricted and will be made available to Phase I awardees. Current Marine Corps clothing and equipment items do not have Midwave Infrared (MWIR) (typically defined as 3-5 micrometer wavelength) or LWIR (typically defined as 8-14 micrometer wavelength) signature mitigation. LWIR imaging sensors based on uncooled microbolometer technology are a particularly pervasive threat as costs associated with such systems continue to go down, while the performance of commercial systems available worldwide are competitive with military-grade capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe intent for this SBIR topic is to explore the development of novel lower-cost textile(s) that incorporate(s) current signature mitigation from VIS to NIR, tentative requirements for SWIR, and a significant increase over current capabilities in MWIR and LWIR signature mitigation. The textile(s) developed in this effort should focus on reducing the probability in identification (of a user), reducing the range of detection, and/or reducing targeting accuracy if detected through NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR sensors. While there are limited commercially available fabrics that mitigate signature from VIS to LWIR, these fabrics are often cost ineffective for the general Marine infantry. Another disadvantage of some current commercial or developmental technologies is overall low comfort or wearability, due to retention of heat, from a user perspective. Additionally, many of these commercial technologies have a short lifespan or use, and must be stored, cared for, and laundered in certain manners. Finally, the existing technologies and current developmental efforts have been developed for Army use, in Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP), and not focused on MARPAT. The intent of the effort is to address the described issues and produce a material/textile solution(s) for tactical use that mitigate individual signature in VIS-LWIR with a reduction in cost, increased wearability, focus on development of MARPAT camouflage solutions, increase ease of storage/transportation, and increase lifecycle use when compared to current commercially available solutions. A textile with such attributes should be perceived as a piece of protective equipment, providing a capability for the Marine force to operate in austere environments undetected. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 2004.20 et seq., National Industrial Security Program Executive Agent and Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) formerly Defense Security Service (DSS). The selected contractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances. This will allow contractor personnel to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and MCSC in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material during the advanced phases of this contract IAW the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), which can be found at Title 32, Part 2004.20 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Vendors shall not be limited in types of materials, structures, additives, and/or finishes and are encouraged to explore innovative or unconventional ideas and methods for textile(s). Consider scalability, launderability, storage and logistical considerations, lifecycle use, general wearability, and function for use in a range of climatic environments to develop successful novel methodologies and concepts for lower-cost signature mitigating textile(s). Proposed textiles may be reversible for multi-use. Provide a theoretical (written) concept for Desert MARPAT. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase I deliverables will include production and delivery of fabric swatch(es)/sample(s) of the most promising concept(s) down selected from the various conceptual approaches- emphasizing quality of solutions rather than quantity. The end state for Phase I will be a physical material/textile sample(s), (a minimum of twelve-by-twelve inch, 12in x 12in, but preferably larger) that mitigates VIS-LWIR signature in Woodland MARPAT, with a theoretical (written) concept for Desert MARPAT. Vendors shall explore and identify any visual (color) tradeoffs or trade space associated with Woodland MARPAT when intersected with success in the NIR, SWIR, MWIR, or LWIR ranges. Phase I deliverables shall also provide a written report detailing ways to optimize and further development in the Phase I Option or a Phase II potential effort. If I Phase I Option is exercised, further develop the most promising textile(s) and conceptualize several end item configurations (in the form of drawings) to be considered for prototypes in Phase II. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will not require access to classified information. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) may be provided to vendors upon award of Phase I.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Explore the novel Phase I technology(s) and/or alternative proposed concept(s) to mature a lower-cost (compared to what is currently commercially available) Woodland MARPAT signature mitigating textile for use in an operationally relevant environment on a dismounted Marine. These textile(s) proposed may be refined to areas of interest which include, but not limited to, overgarments/ponchos, personnel covers, and personal hide sites. Concepts should consider multi-functionality of the textile(s) to reduce the burden of number, size, and weight to the Marine. Further refine visual appearance; tune NIR and SWIR values to meet current and potential future USMC requirements (available with a signed NDA), further develop MWIR and LWIR signature mitigation, reduce cost, increase wearability, decrease or address logistical/transportation/storage concerns, and increase lifecycle and explore launderability of proposed textiles. Textile(s) matured in Phase II must be practical for a dismounted infantry Marine to wear, use, transport, and care for. Practical for a dismounted infantry Marine can be defined as creating no to minimal (maximum of 16 oz/sq yd for the textile, objective under 7 oz/sq yd) additional burden in terms of weight as well as the textile must function (in terms of use) in all weather and not be damaged by elements (rain, hail, snow, etc), and the care/ transportation of the textile (must be packable in a deployers bag, must be able to be stored in non-climate controlled facilities during travel to and from facilities, must be launderable if necessary).

The antenna will be used to transmit/receive Skywave radio-wave signals to provide Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications on Navy aircraft.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: In the absence of satellite communication channels, current and future missions require aircraft to communicate at High Frequencies (HF) for BLOS communications. The principle constraint on modern air platforms are size and weight which drives the need for smaller, lighter, efficient radio and antenna technologies. The innovative use of metamaterials has shown to be a promising technology to reduce size and weight while achieving effective power characteristics when compared to conventional antenna designs at other portions of the RF spectrum. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the use of metamaterials in antenna design could dramatically reduce the size of the antenna and may improve other antenna parameters such as enhancing bandwidth and increasing gain at HF. The challenge is to determine if metamaterials can significantly reduce the size and weight of an HF antenna, be affordable, and be suitable for installation on Navy platforms. Innovative solutions are being sought to develop an HF antenna that can meet the design goals shown below.

Develop a side-by-side structured two-color LED array with narrow spectral bandwidths with two different spectral bands between 3\u20135 \u00b5m.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Chemical sensing, IRSP, and spectroscopy applications require improved MWIR [3\u20135 \u00b5m]) LED arrays. A 1024 X 1024 dual-band MWIR LED array that incorporates narrow-band emission LEDs to provide electromagnetic radiation in two spectral bands is highly beneficial. The narrow-band emission of LEDs will enable more precise spectral emissions for analysis of chemical composition, provide the core technology for smaller, lighter IRSPs, and provide the capability for better wavelength selection of two-color absorption spectroscopy. Narrow-band LED arrays with enhanced efficiencies that increase the brightness of individual LED pixels to replicate temperatures above 1500 K will improve signal levels for both chemical sensing and spectroscopy. The two-color LED arrays of an IRSP will improve the fidelity of projection systems for more effective Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) and live-virtual-constructive (LVC) testing of missile warning systems (MWS). It will be extremely difficult to meet all these needs using current technologies.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe simulation of range-dependent high-fidelity threat signatures in complex environments for rendering images of HITL engagements is necessary for two-color MWS HITL ground testing and performance evaluation. Enhanced high-brightness LED arrays must provide a high-dynamic range and sufficient bit-depth to render variable thermal environments. Current IR scene projectors based on resistive emitter arrays have performance shortcomings such as low-radiance, slow-frame rates, and small-frame sizes. MWIR narrow-band emission LEDs will be optimized to produce higher in-band radiance at higher frame rates and larger frame sizes than existing technologies. Existing MWIR LED arrays produce photons over a broadband spectrum and have low photon-generation efficiency that affects spectral banded light levels and induces cross-band detection of narrow-band detectors. These issues make broadband LEDs unattractive for narrow-band detection. By contrast, a dual-band IRSP or spectroscopes incorporating two-color narrow-band LED arrays, which exhibit higher efficiency and brightness, will better match detection requirements. A collocated side-by-side two-color pixel design of a two-color LED array will allow independent electrical control of each color pixel and 16-bit continuous wave operation in a 1024 X 1024 format.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic will investigate two-color narrow-band LED arrays with emissions wavelengths centered for chemical sensing, sensor, or spectroscopy detection. The LED array will have a cross-talk value of less than 1% at an effective temperature of 450 K, designed to enhance the MWIR LED efficiency and brightness. Proposed approaches include designing, fabricating, and characterizing two-color MWIR LED arrays using narrow-band emission LEDs that match the in-band MWIR wavelength ranges. An electronically multiplexed LED array suitable for high-fidelity hardware-in-the-loop will have a Phase I LED array approach designed and a Phase II demonstration.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese attributes improve spatial and spectral resolution for chemical detection, IRSP, and spectroscopy applications. Improved chemical sensing and spectroscopy have applications for warfighter battlefield safety. The LED spectral bands will be determined for the warfighter&#39;s desired application. The two-color array design will include a RIIC approach with 16-bit capability. The LED will be designed for high-frame rates, low-cross talk, and variable set temperatures to improve the ability to design high-fidelity systems. These design features will improve electrical efficiency, which will improve reliability to lower lifecycle costs. This will allow the test programs to tailor flight test scenarios based on HITL test results, reduce their flight hour requirements, and improve overall test efficiency. For chemical sensing and spectroscopy, this capability will support the needs of the warfighter for the analysis and detection of biological or chemical agents. The Navy is in need of enhanced MWIR scene projectors that are smaller and lighter weight for placement on MWS HITL and flight line T & E.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Write a final report of the design and feasibility of a high-brightness two-color mid-wave-infrared LED array structure including the RIIC concept. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a 1024 X 1024 two-color LED array structure with independently controlled pixels by a RIIC. Demonstrate a two color MWIR (3\u20135 \u00b5m) narrow spectral band (< 100 nm) LED array with a 300\u20131500 K dynamic range and 16-bit resolution and per specifications based on the research and development of results developed during Phase I for DoD applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The two-color IR LED array is developed for integration into two-color IR scene projector. Transition the IRSP to the Navy.\r\n\r\nA two-color IR LED has potential application for industrial chemical sensing and safety protection. An IRSP has application for both firefighter and medical scenario training.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCanedy, C. L., Bewley, W. W., Tomasulo, S., Kim, C. S., Merritt, C.

This shock absorber will be required to dampen initial shock impulses and resist forces applied to it by converting kinetic energy to another form (such as heat or electricity) that can be safely dumped to the ambient environment. State-of-the-art shock absorbers are comparatively much smaller in size than required for this application. Prior research in this area of study has primarily focused on the fields of electromagnetism, and materials and fluid sciences, including rheology and tribology. However, innovative solutions leveraging other advances or developing new technologies are also welcome and encouraged. Although non-mechanical adjustment is preferred, the Navy is open to all ideas and will not limit innovation or disqualify a particular class of concepts. Many Navy and commercial applications utilizing relatively smaller shock absorbers and/or hydraulic cylinders would benefit from this technology if successful. The requirements of this shock absorber are as follows: \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n1. A shock absorber that is larger in size than typical shock absorbers, and that can be adjusted/programmed to a specific setting prior to an event in order to optimize the resistance (i.e., rate of energy absorption) given the expected initial conditions. \r\n\r\n2. The shock absorber shall be required to damp initial shock impulses and resist forces applied to it, converting kinetic energy to another form of removable energy. \r\n\r\n3. Heat must be released; electricity must be dumped/recovered.\r\n\r\n4. The shock absorber design may include typical components, such as a cylinder, piston rod, accumulator, and check valve; or utilize a completely novel design.\r\n\r\n5. Non-mechanical settings adjustment is preferred, but not mandatory. \r\n\r\n6. Scalability of this technology is a desired objective. \r\n\r\n7. The shock absorber shall satisfy all requirements in the military standards for vibration (MIL-STD-167-1A [Type 1]), shock (MIL-DTL-901E [Grade A]), electromagnetic interference (MIL-STD-461G), and environmental factors (MIL-STD-810H).\r\n\r\n8. The shock absorber shall be operable in an industrial and marine environment. \r\n\r\n9. Shock absorber shall fit within a space of 23 in. by 23 in. by 109 in. (58.42 cm by 58.42 cm by 276.86 cm) compressed.\r\n\r\n10. Shock absorber stroke shall be no greater than 9 ft (2.74 m). \r\n\r\n11. The shock absorber weight, including supports, shall not exceed 10,500 lb. (4,762.72 kg). \r\n\r\n12. The shock absorber connects to a wire rope via multiple sheaves. Due to the nature of the application, the piston rod (or equivalent) will experience a different amount of input force and speed each time it is cycled. The velocity and force of the cable shock absorber shall be predictable in nature for set input loads.\r\n\r\n13. The shock absorber shall be adjustable by adjusting the rate of stroke/energy absorption for low, medium, and high energy events (or with greater granularity). \r\n\r\n14. The shock absorber shall compress during an event, and then extend to its original position after an event; this application does not call for a shock absorber that oscillates in the positive and negative directions during operation. \r\n\r\n15. The shock absorber shall be adjustable to satisfy all specifications of the existing shock absorber operations. \r\n\r\n16. The shock absorber shall be controllable/programmable to provide a force from nominally 0 lbf to 250,000 lbf, throughout its stroke and speed range, with a max stroke of 9 ft (2.74 m) and a speed range of 0 ft/s to 40 ft/s (0 m/s to 12.2 m/s), all while maintaining positive tension on the wire rope. \r\n\r\n17. The shock absorber shall be controllable/programmable in its return to starting position by providing nominally 0 lb. to 35,000 lb. (0 kg to 15,875.73 kg) of force and 0 ft/s to 5 ft/s (0 m/s to 1.52 m/s). \r\n\r\n18. The shock absorber shall provide a resistive force of up to 35,000 lb. (15,875.73 kg) indefinitely while in its starting position. \r\n\r\n19. The tunable shock absorber shall have a minimum of 3 settings. \r\n\r\n20. It is desirable that the shock absorber is capable of adjusting its setting within 5 seconds; however, if longer times are necessary to adjust the shock absorber setting, the setting shall be constantly maintained throughout repetitive cycles without deliberate adjustment. \r\n\r\n21. The shock absorber shall operate within a temperature range of -13\u00b0F and 149\u00b0F (-25\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C) and withstand a storage temperature range of -27 \u00b0F and 160 \u00b0F (-33 \u00b0C and 71 \u00b0C). \r\n\r\n22. The shock absorber shall provide functionality repeatedly for multiple cycles, at a minimum cycle time of 45 seconds, for 28 consecutive cycles in 21 minutes. \r\n\r\n23. The shock absorber will experience cyclic loading so consideration in later phases shall be given to how repeated use will affect performance from a thermal and stress/fatigue standpoint.\r\n\r\n24. The shock absorber shall be capable of supporting a cyclic operation sustained rate of 4,200 (Threshold)/5,600 (Objective) total cycles sustained over 30 operating days (12 hrs.).\r\n\r\n25. The shock absorber shall be capable of supporting a surge cyclic operation sustained rate of 270 (Threshold)/310 (Objective) total cycles sustained over four (4) (Threshold)/6 (Objective) operating days (24 hrs.).\r\n\r\n26. The shock absorber shall be capable of supporting a cyclic operation of at least 500,000 cycles within a 25-yr life without failure in fatigue. \r\n\r\n27. The shock absorber shall be capable of monitoring and providing real-time information on the stroke position as well as the conditions of the system (e.g., hydraulic pressure and temperature). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe ability to provide dynamic control throughout the shock absorber stroke is not required. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nInnovative solutions leveraging other advances or developing new technologies are also welcome and encouraged.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design and develop a concept for an adjustable shock absorber that utilizes technologies that will allow it to function at the scale required for this application. Demonstrate feasibility using modeling and simulation, including 3D computer-aided design (CAD), fluid mechanics, stress analysis, control theory, and other appropriate design methodologies. Clearly explain the means by which the shock absorber response is adjusted. Full-scale designs are preferred, even at this preliminary stage, as size is considered one of the primary challenges. Subscale designs are allowable assuming the concept is scalable. A subscale design has value in that it can be used to inform creation of a physical prototype, which will be required in Phase II. If only a subscale design is provided during Phase I, supporting documentation will be required to assess whether the subscale system can be scaled-up effectively to meet requirements. Prepare a Phase II plan that includes prototype development plans.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design and build a shock absorber prototype based on Phase I work. Prototype design may also include design of a system capable of subjecting the shock absorber to forces that vary in magnitude. Demonstrate the technology by performing preliminary tests that impart characteristic forces on the shock absorber. Utilize sensors and data acquisition to illustrate how the shock absorber absorbs energy/shock, and how the absorption changes when tuned to different settings. Employ iterative design, incorporating changes based on lessons learned during repeated testing. Complete the design, perform final testing, and validate that the concept meets operational needs and will work at scale. Prepare a Phase III commercialization/transition plan that includes construction of a full-scale prototype and verification against requirements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Design, develop, and fabricate a full-scale working adjustable shock absorber based on work completed during earlier phases. Perform final testing at full-scale velocities and forces to validate and verify performance. Demonstrate adjustability by absorbing low, medium, and high energies as described.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nShock absorbers are used in countless mechanical applications in both the private sector and the DoD to attenuate unexpected shocks and in hydraulic and pneumatic mechanical control systems. The most commonly known applications for shock absorbers are in automobiles to prevent excessive bouncing when a vehicle wheel encounters a road hazard or a pothole. With an adjustable shock absorber, a mechanical control system can increase its functional range without being physically replaced, dramatically increasing the functional range of hydraulic and pneumatic control systems.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDepartment of Defense.

One relatively new area of study and application involves Three Dimensional (3D) stereoscopic systems based on HSV hardware, which are then utilized to identify fragments in-flight emanating from a warhead. These 3D stereoscopic systems have been evaluated by the DoD for use in fragment characterization tests, usually referred to as \u201carena tests\u201d with varying degrees of success depending on the metric of interest. Fragment position, speed, and vector information offers the greatest confidence; however, fragment mass remains an elusive parameter in such assessments. This parameter is a key measure in the U.S. Navy\u2019s and DoD\u2019s vision of leveraging advanced diagnostics, and the data generated from these, in the calibration of High Fidelity Multiphysics hydrocodes currently in use.\r\n\r\nGiven these challenges, there is a need for innovative engineering solutions that allows the U.S. Navy and the DoD to bridge the last data gap related to 3D stereoscopic HSV systems by creating a general purpose fragment mass estimation library for use in high-fidelity codes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSolutions (e.g., General Purpose Mass Estimation Library) must be able to leverage the 3D stereoscopic raw data independent of intrinsic hardware used. Additionally, the solution must generate verifiable and validated fragment mass data from said 3D stereoscopic raw data. The solution must work for all possible types, namely natural (e.g., random shapes), pre-scored and preformed fragments, as well as multiple materials such as\u2014but not limited to\u2014steel, aluminum, titanium, or tungsten compositions. The solution must be able to create accurate mass assessment for fragments in the range of 10 to 2500 grains, traveling at speeds ranging from 500\u20139000 ft/s (152.4\u20132743.2 m/s). Mass estimate generated from the solution must be calibrated to have uncertainties less than +/- 4% for fragments at 2500 grains, and less than +/- 20% for fragments at 10 grain levels (e.g., Mass Estimate threshold) from verifiable and validated data source(s). Based on this, the mass tolerance threshold would follow a linear relationship (e.g., Mass Tolerance Threshold [fragment mass, in grains] = 0.0394 * fragment mass + 1.604, Mass Tolerance Threshold has units of grains as well).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nVerifiable and validated data sources for calibrating the proposed solution may be, but are not limited to, experimental or other empirical datasets, including any other representative Modeling and Simulation (M&S) techniques. Calibration must be performed at laboratory scale to include full mass scale. The solution may leverage precomputed data/regressions and/or any Machine Learning (ML) techniques. If ML techniques are utilized, open source tools/methods must be leveraged to the greatest extent possible. As part of the solution, a verification and validation package on the general purpose mass estimation library must be created along with any other required SBIR reporting, allowing full transparency to Subject Matter Experts (SME) in the U.S. Navy and DoD.\r\n\r\nThe solution must be able to generate mass estimates within seconds on a per fragment basis and within minutes for an entire populated 3D stereoscopic raw data set potentially consisting of thousands of fragments. The solution must have an appropriate and well-documented interface or Application Programming Interface (API) if relevant, so that other software tools may be able to leverage it effectively. The solution must be compatible with use inside modern Operating Systems (OS) such as Microsoft Windows and Linux. The solution must provide clear text data output consisting of estimated mass, as well as any ancillary graphical depiction of the post-processing results including statistical uncertainties in output values.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Identify and evaluate potential technologies/methodologies applicable for the solution. The feasibility study may include limited/initial lab scale test or M&S efforts that help provide grounding to a proposal/study. A preliminary design of the general purpose library and methodology will be performed that includes identification of current/future resources in the form of existing software packages and/or empirical or M&S datasets. Create (1) a preliminary engineering development plan that includes an evaluation of potential numerical/ML methodologies, calibration plans, and testing program needed and (2) a preliminary post-processing and analysis plan for the general purpose library that includes the proposed analysis/computational logic flow needed in order to meet the mass estimate uncertainties across the range of parameters indicated. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a working prototype. Demonstrate the prototype, including applicable testing of any post-processing features, and with laboratory scenarios/data including full scale scenarios, with comparison of the output data and associated uncertainties. Proposed solution must demonstrate capability for expansion in light of new test or M&S data enhancing the verification and validation package. Integrate the solution into a larger software package as directed by the Government or provide technical support in the event that the Government integrates it. Deliver source code, binaries, libraries, trained ML, verification and validation package, design specifications, configuration and user\u2019s manual for Government evaluation. Provide technical support for Government use of prototype libraries within a larger Community of Interest of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition the updated solution to the U.S. Navy. Receive feedback from users and perform/release updates addressing feature requests and bug fixes.

Additionally, this effort will develop the capability to conduct automatic analysis of blue (friendly) communications to understand speed and accuracy of information exchange.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: As the carrier airwing of the future prepares for the high-end fight, the training paradigm will shift to almost exclusively Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) environments due to expanded range capabilities of the peer threat competitors and Operations Security (OPSEC) considerations. As a result, warfighters are able to train as they fight with higher fidelity scenarios that more accurately represent red kill chains. This high-fidelity, data rich environment provides unique opportunities for instructional strategies to better support end-to-end training and improve readiness. Specifically, LVC environments increase the amount of\u2014and access to\u2014data that can support improved scenario generation, performance assessment, and debrief when utilized appropriately. However, LVC training is not without its challenges. These challenges include resource requirements to develop these high-fidelity scenarios as they can be cumbersome and labor intensive. Moreover, scenarios that do not contain significant variations may lose utility very quickly as operators can begin to anticipate scenario outcomes after a few exposures. Consequently, a need exists for rapid generation of real-time, adaptive, high-fidelity scenarios. \r\n\r\nAdditional challenges lie in the assessment of performance. The carrier airwing of the future will rely on integrated tactics that require a level of coordination and information exchange across platforms that have not been required in past tactics. The complexity of coordination associated with integrated tactics necessitates a significant amount of voice communications across the different platforms to provide Situational Awareness (SA) and elicit decision-making. While communication is critical to cross platform coordination and overall tactical execution, it remains one of the most challenging training objectives to meet during Air Defense events. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs such, this effort seeks to alleviate identified challenges with scenario generation and performance assessment through the investigation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) (e.g., DALL-E, ChatGPT) or other forms of AI to support scenario generation and communications assessment. This SBIR effort shall focus on utilizing AI to learn from pilot-in-the-loop red threat behavior to rapidly generate constructive threat presentations that adapt to trainee behavior in a tactically feasible manner. Additionally, AI shall be applied to further the state-of-the-science in communications analysis [Ref 6]. Specifically, AI shall support analysis of blue recorded communications and provide an initial assessment in terms of accuracy of the words said (relative to ground truth) and speed at which they are said. This analysis will include digesting communication recordings, assessing quality of communications-based accuracy and speed, and then providing these results via automated debrief.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese capabilities will improve the quality of training and readiness via end-to-end training enhancements. First, high-fidelity Air Defense scenarios that can be rapidly generated and are adaptive will yield greater training utility and provide cost avoidance associated with scenario development manpower and human-in-loop threat support manpower. Next, development of a communications analysis and debrief capability will improve SA, and decision making will benefit the Fleet by decreasing instructor workload, reducing human error and manpower time requirements, and automatically provide instructors with information on communication protocol adherence and timeliness to improve SA and increase debriefing capabilities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis effort will specifically look at Air Defense training scenarios within LVC environments to increase speed at which high-fidelity, adaptive scenarios can be generated and assessed to enhance operator performance. This capability will be developed with the intention of a transition path to the Next Generation Threat System (NGTS).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

This will include investigating unclassified sample data to determine appropriate AI models for future development. Additionally, Phase I will focus on identifying the most appropriate AI model or models to support automatic analysis of blue communications based on accuracy and speed results. An unclassified sample dataset will be provided to help support this investigation and to understand speed and accuracy of information exchange. Both objectives will use generative or other forms of AI. Performance assessment should focus on communications but may also include tactical assessments. Noise filtering shall be investigated to support communication analysis as the noise content in the operational environment for Air Defense is significant. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDemonstrate the feasibility of application into the larger, integrated training system.

Additionally, the plan shall include a Subject Matter Expert (SME) evaluation of capabilities and methods for conducting an Analysis of Alternatives to identify best practice method moving forward for training delivery.\r\n\r\nProvide prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Research, develop, design, and deliver a proof-of-scenario generation and communication assessment capabilities for Air Defense training scenarios through execution of the integration plan developed in Phase I. During Phase II, the sample data provided will be more tactically and operationally relevant and classified at the SECRET level. Developers can expect the scenarios to be more tactically complex, have larger amount of communication, and communications will include significant background noise. Noise will include, but is not limited to, background noise (engines, alerts, etc.), static, and the like. Integration with NGTS will enhance the capability with scenarios and performance data already resident in NGTS. Design and develop the tool to include visualizations, usability documentation, and technology evaluation. Demonstration of the tool, along with documentation of usability of the training software is critical. Risk Management Framework guidelines should be considered and adhered to during the development to support information assurance compliance. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork in Phase II may become classified. Please see note in the Description paragraph.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Introduce additional data from NGTS as well as other Live-and-Virtual entities within the scenario. Scenario generation shall be enhanced to include external (live and/or virtual) entities. The AI implementation should account for any differences or effects external entities may have on the AI model. The voice communication assessment capabilities shall be flexible as to be deployed in varying training configurations. Training locations may differ in their setup of radios and networked communications, which will require easy and configurable settings and controls. Integration testing and demonstration of capabilities will be conducted in a distributed simulation via Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol at the SECRET level. Software shall be integrated with NGTS to facilitate transition into operational LVC environment. Documentation and any supporting materials shall be delivered to NGTS team for maintenance and future enhancements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe AI voice assessment model can be leveraged in the private sector as a speech-to-text model in environments with high noise or when non-standard English speech is in use, such as the brevity communications made during a tactical aviation scenario. Most AI speech models are trained with common English phrases. The data and voice communications from the tactical aviation domain will provide more robust speech-to-text analysis for the private sector in areas such as air traffic control or brevity communications training.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBaidoo-Anu, D., & Owusu Ansah, L.

Over the course of many years and significant investment, the solid rocket motor is designed, tested, and qualified to achieve this predetermined thrust profile. Thus, when a new missile enters the field, there is a precisely known thrust profile and capability; however, this limits the system to specific and planned threat engagements. Changes to the specified thrust profile result in costly grain redesign and requalification. As new gaps are identified, new missiles are developed to fill those gaps. This increases the number of boutique missiles the military must now manage with the associated logistical footprint. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks to develop a solid propulsion system technology that allows for modulation of thrust at time of launch or during flight to optimize missile performance relative to real-time mission objectives. Real-time thrust control of solid propulsion is a game-changing technology that has the ability to enable collaborative munitions where in-flight missiles can be redirected and throttled to engage evolving threats. Throttleable solid propulsion will also allow for mission flexibility or multi-payload, single-motor capability. When a single system is able to support multiple roles, the need for new boutique systems is reduced, as are the associated development costs. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThrust control of solid propellants has been demonstrated to varying degrees with technologies\u2014including pintle nozzle\u2014to control the nozzle throat area [Ref 1], high-pressure self-extinguishing propellants [Ref 2], pulsed motors [Ref 3], and electrically-activated propellant [Ref 4]. Some of these technologies are currently utilized in fielded rocket motors because of their ability to control thrust, but their use is very system specific and their thrust control is limited. This topic seeks new or evolved approaches to thrust control of solid propulsion systems. The technology may be complimentary to other thrust control solutions to build a more dynamic overall system.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of this topic is to develop a technology that can create effects on an energetic system to allow for the variation of thrust/time within a rocket motor. The developed technology should maximize compatibility/usage of existing rocket motor materials (propellant oxidizers and binders, insulation, liners, motor cases) and existing industry fabrication methods, as well as leverage industrial best-practices and minimize transition hurdles. The technology needs to minimize the size and weight impact on the rocket motor as gains in flexible energy management can be lost to parasitic weight. Additionally, the technology needs to have a path to be usable in the challenging thermal (-65 \u00b0F\u2013150 \u00b0F) (-53.9 \u00b0C\u201365.5 \u00b0C) and mechanical environments (shock/vibe) required to enter military usage. Hardware and software required to integrate with the technology also needs to be considered as the technology matures.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

Outline how the concept works (how and where effects are placed on the rocket motor to modulate thrust) and identify the individual components needed for insertion into a rocket motor. Maturity of the individual components will be assessed relative to the development needed for use in a solid propellant rocket motor. A notional system will be developed to demonstrate the bounds for thrust control. Lab scale testing and/or analysis will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept\u2019s ability to control rocket motor thrust. Testing may or may not include energetic material. Prepare a report outlining the findings of Phase I plus a technology maturation plan for Phase II. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a Phase II series of prototype rocket motors for evaluation. The prototypes will be used to evaluate the ability to achieve a wide variation of thrust/time profiles from identical motors. The prototype rocket motors will all be identical in design and materials (propellant, nozzle dimensions, igniter, etc.), so that testing can be done on any motor to achieve the desired thrust. The motor size will be based on the capability of the small business, but the propellant grain will not be smaller than 2 in. diameter X 4 in. length (5.08 cm diameter X 10.16 cm length). Pretest ballistics will be performed for each test to determine the thrust/time profile. The thrust/time profile will be preprogramed before each test. Post-test comparisons will be conducted to update models and ensure the prototypes are performing in a reasonably predictive manner. The intent is to demonstrate four different thrust/time profiles from identical prototype rocket motors. During Phase II, the sub-components will be identified and tracked for maturity. A final report will be provided that outlines the prototype design, fabrication, and testing. The report will also outline the less mature aspects of the technology and provide a plan to further mature the technology in Phase III. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork in Phase II may become classified.

It is still allowable to have an external control unit to modulate the thrust. Demonstrate two static firings of identical rocket motors with different thrust/time profiles. Provide a final report that documents the design and testing results, includes a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment, outlines the volume and mass requirements for a thrust-control system in a tactical missile, and outlines a path to further mature the technology.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe development of solid propellant thrust control would have applications to space-based systems including launching of satellites and satellite maneuvering.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBurroughs, S.

Improvements to track initiation and measurement association are necessary to maintain reliable system performance in these challenging scenarios.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently fielded track-before-detect approaches assume that a single undetected object such as a submarine, surface ship, or persistent clutter object, may be in the field at any given time, and as a result, performance is degraded when multiple objects ought to be promoted to contact followers at once. In addition, single hypothesis tracking can lead to confusion for low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) targets with a significant number of clutter detections inside typical association gates. In the difficult association situations described previously, where tracks may cross or converge, the need for innovative approaches to the association problem are even more necessary. Advances in Bayesian tracking techniques have been developed to address these problems, even in the presence of substantial stationary clutter.\r\n\r\nSuccessful approaches to the multi-target tracking problem will initiate contact followers when multiple targets (or target-like objects such as surface ships) are present in the field, and maintain track integrity when multiple tracks are temporally and spatially close (within the area of uncertainty of a single measurement).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

Traditional methods for detecting corrosion defects are inefficient, and involve costly removal and replacement of the coatings and paints for visual inspection of the underlying surface. Removal and replacement of these polymer or painted sections involve costly operations in terms of labor and materials costs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic seeks a solution of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of hidden corrosion underneath paints or polymers. Corrosion of aluminum alloys generally develops as pitting or thinning, and in general changes a nominally smooth surface to an uneven and irregular surface, which can then result in cracking. \r\n\r\nThe detection of this type of corrosion is not within line of sight. The detection of corrosion on aluminum formers that are under composite skins without disassembly would be very beneficial. Inspection through top coats would be ideal. The proposed solution should be able to detect defects with sizes greater than 0.005 in. (0.0127 cm) on a curved surface with a radius of curvature 2 in. (5.08 cm) radius or less. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution should be able to detect fastener corrosion. The proposed method should also detect corrosion on fastener threads without the need for disassembly. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic focuses on development of technologies that will image corrosion and defects through coatings and paints rapidly enough to support a sampled or completed NDE of an aircraft. The system should be portable that weighs no more than 12 lbs. (5.44 kg), be capable of expected constant system mobility without need for recalibration more than once annually, and sufficiently robust for operations under harsh maritime environmental conditions. The system needs to be in compliance with all FCC regulations. The preferred system prototype solution should yield detection results as close to real time as possible, and be equipped with a graphical user interface that is easy to use and understood by an operator with relevant training. It is also expected that any proposed system should have built-in wireless capability that can send imaging data to a remote user system for further detection analysis and evaluation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop an imaging system with the capability to meet the operational, frequency, SNR, minimum corrosion/defect size, minimum paints/coatings thickness, and graphical user interface and wireless transceiver as stated in the Description. Detection of a defect is defined as the ability to accurately distinguish the defect from surrounding regions that do not contain the defect, and display the location and size of the defect in a graphic user interface. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concept to detect the aforementioned hidden defects via modeling and simulation. Concept feasibility will be supported by appropriate analyses and laboratory experiments. Provide a Phase II development plan that includes performance goals and key technical milestones. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype suitable for evaluation. Evaluate the performance of the prototype with regard to the goals defined in Phase I on a Navy provided test panel that is equivalent to testing on an in-service Navy asset under similar field conditions. Based on the initial results of the evaluation, refine the prototype and demonstrate that the final prototype meets the performance specifications stated in the Description. Deliver the final prototype at the end of the Phase II that is ready for field testing by the Navy.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition the technology into a system that can be acquired by the Navy. The Phase III plan should include testing, validation, certification, and qualification for Navy use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith the ability to inspect aluminum material/structure under polymer and paint, this will provide the private sector with new instrumentation for detecting degradation of aluminum material. This instrumentation will certainly improve the maintenance of commercial aviation assets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAnastasi, R. F., Madaras, E. I., Seebo, J. P., Smith, S.

Often the weak link in these designs is the sensing aperture, whether it be an Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) window or a Radio Frequency (RF) radome. In addition to being a structural material, these must also be transparent within the relevant wavebands, and maintain this transmission throughout the flight. This limits material choice significantly, and forces performance trade-offs to survive the high enthalpies. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOver the duration of a flight profile, transient heating of a window typically involves an energy balance of convective heat transfer, radiative heat transfer and conduction between the window, the external environment the weapon is flying through, the internal environment of the weapon, the weapon structure the window is attached to and the radiative exchange between the window and both the external and internal environments. The majority of the flight profile results in a strong convective aeroheating input into the window with some periods of aerocooling where the window is hotter than the surrounding recovery temperatures. As the window rises in temperature, radiative heat loss to both the external and internal environments also occurs. As the window temperature gets hotter, the magnitude of that radiative heat loss increases by a factor of temperature to the fourth power and at higher temperatures can result in equilibrium temperatures hundreds of degrees cooler than without the presence of radiative heat loss. Heat removal due to convection is limited in effectiveness due to the flight speeds involved and the negative effects of relying on internal convection to sink heat to the interior of the weapon. Enhancing the conduction of windows is limited in effectiveness without unintentionally altering the electromagnetic properties; plus the structural attachment location of the window is at similar temperatures, preventing the needed thermal gradient to conduct heat away into those surrounding structures. Radiation, however, is different; while the distribution of energy \u201cavailable\u201d to be radiated is simply a function of temperature (known as the blackbody curve), each material has its own emission spectrum, which describes at what wavelengths energy can be emitted. There is often, and in the case of IR windows necessarily, a gap in which the material cannot emit radiation. If part of the blackbody curve lies within this gap, that energy cannot be radiated, and as such can\u2019t contribute to cooling the window.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is particularly a problem for IR windows, which rely on this gap in order to function. The typical mid-wave IR (MWIR) band is from 3\u20135 \u00b5m, meaning there can be little to no emission within these wavelengths, and typically not much below this as well. Even at the relatively low temperature of 500 \u00b0C, nearly 50% of the available energy lies between 1 and 5 \u00b5m, where essentially no emissions are expected to occur. This only gets more significant as temperatures climb and the blackbody curve shifts to shorter wavelengths. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf even narrow emission peaks could be engineered at shorter wavelengths, without interfering with the desired transmission window, it could increase energy dissipated through radiation drastically. At 1000 \u00b0C, a half micron band centered around 2.25 \u00b5m contains 15% of the energy available in the entire spectrum, roughly the same as all emission above 6 \u00b5m (which is about where state-of-the-art MWIR windows begin emitting). If this unused energy can be taken advantage of, the range of environments a window could operate in could be greatly expanded, and with it the mission space and possibly the performance of the system as a whole. A similar approach was used on the space shuttle, with the black tiles on the bottom used to maximize emissivity; it just didn\u2019t have the complication of needing to be a functioning aperture.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA successful project would produce a set of test articles demonstrating a significant increase in emissivity while maintaining transmission characteristics at high temperatures (> 1000 \u00b0C for IR materials, > 1250 \u00b0C for RF materials) within the chosen waveband (MWIR, X-Band, Ka-Band, etc.). The test articles must also demonstrate resiliency to stresses which would be encountered in high-speed flight. Testing for this may vary depending on the proposed solution, but may include: high high-temperature mechanical tests, thermal shock tests, electrical tests, arcjet/plasma torch testing, and microstructural examinations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a process/material that demonstrates significantly increased emissivity of the chosen window material without degradation of transmission in the relevant waveband. Show that the concept can feasibly meet the requirements of high-speed flight through analysis, modeling, and/or characterization of materials of interest. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver notional full-scale prototypes (minimum of two) that demonstrate functionality under the required service conditions, including thermal and mechanical stresses. Produce sufficient test samples for material characterization efforts to show viability for high-speed flight as described in the Description section.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Work with a program office to produce a system-applicable window. Participate in qualification testing equivalent to the system, including environmental and hypersonic wind tunnel testing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere have been some recent efforts looking into controlling emissivity to provide efficiency increases in thermophotovoltaic power generation, which this could possibly feed into. Space applications are also possible, as the only way to dump heat in a vacuum is through radiation. There could be some niche private sector applications, which utilize high-temperature windows as well, but unless commercial high-speed travel grows, this market is limited.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHarris, D.

Along with their advantages in ease of operation and low cost, the widespread availability of UAVs has posed significant security threats in both defense and civilian arenas. As part of the effective UAV threat mitigations for the DoD, it is first necessary to be able to detect and identify UAVs in the airspace in a timely manner before UAV interdiction strategies can be executed arenas [Refs 1-3]. Straightforward adoption of currently fielded airspace surveillance technologies will not suffice as UAVs are much smaller in physical size and fly at lower altitudes. Furthermore, recent advances in UAV technology have enabled the capability of large swarms of UAVs flying together in either uncoordinated or coordinated groups. These UAV swarms with continuously growing swarm sizes pose an even more serious and emerging threats to the Navy forces, assets, and installations. These UAV swarms pose additional challenges to counter them over that posed by dealing with UAVs one or two at a time. In fact, there are reports that suggest that the Chinese military is strategizing attacking the U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups with swarms of multi-mission UAVs during a conventional naval conflict [Ref 4]. Many target detection and tracking systems rely on passive medium wavelength infrared/long wavelength infrared (MWIR/LWIR) thermal infrared cameras. LWIR camera in particular offers unique advantages and their performances are not adversely degraded from scattering by water-based aerosols, snow, rain, fog, and clouds in the atmosphere. However, it is still challenging to detect and identify small UAVs using IR imagers alone due to the low contrast in the thermal imagery, especially in environments cluttered with background noise. The various growing configurations of current and emergent UAVs and growing threats of UAV swarms, make a single optimized sensor solution in a timely fashion impractical and ineffective. The breadth of this UAV swarm threat is both wide in scope and deep in complexity. It therefore warrants a more capable solution tailored for different circumstances. To maintain a more robust situation awareness and to provide much improved protection for naval assets and forces against current and future UAV swarm threats, it is therefore logical to consider a speedy counter UAV swarms system comprising of a suite of multiple sensors with different modalities [Ref 4]. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is the objective of this SBIR topic to develop sensor fusion methodology from phased array radar system [Ref 5] and MWIR/LWIR infrared cameras to combine data from different and orthogonal modalities to generate inferences that would not be possible from a single sensor alone. To deal with a large swarm of targets, a phased array radar system can steer a narrow beam quickly to identify and target multiple targets in multiple directions simultaneously without having to physically move the system, as opposed to a spinning antenna from a legacy radar system. The target scope of data fusion from multiple sensors is to achieve much more accurate and faster results in UAVs detection, identification, and tracking than those derived from single sensors, while compensating for their individual weaknesses. Fusion of multiple sensors in a UAV swarms target acquisition and cueing system requires managing, interpreting, and analyzing a large set of heterogeneous input data. It is also expected that the sensors fusion and the detection/tracking algorithm would enable the detection, identification, and tracking of the UAV swarm in a matter of a few seconds instead of minutes. The low system latency of detection/identification/tracking of swarms of increasing UAV numbers is particularly critical in combat scenario to allow sufficient time to counter the threats. Recent advances in deep learning presents the ability to manage diverse and complex data. In particular, deep learning technique enables learning relationships between dissimilar input signals, such as the behavior pattern and relationship of the UAVs within a swarm. Multi-sensor learning is capable of understanding in detail real-world problems, as well as filling the missing or corrupted sensor data. Deep learning-based algorithm combined with multiple sensors for counter UAV swarm application has never been developed before for low-latency target detection and tracking. In order to exploit the advances in LWIR/MWIR imaging, radar systems, and deep learning, the Navy is seeking an innovative, game-changing approach in this application of deep learning on multi-sensor data fusion and exploitation system for accelerated UAV swarm detection, identification, and tracking.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFusing tactical data from radar and infrared cameras poses significant challenges due to the diversity and complexity of the data, for example track count, accuracy, update rates, and uncertainty. The data sources often have different formats, resolutions, and phenomenologies, making it difficult to correlate the data accurately. Additionally, the tactical data can be affected by external factors such as weather, environmental conditions, and UAV swarm movements, which can lead to misinterpretation or misclassification of the data. Fusion algorithms must be able to handle these challenges and effectively fuse the tactical data to provide a reliable, real-time view of the UAVs swarm with the following performance:\r\n\r\nFirst, the system must be able to ingest data from radar and infrared cameras in real time or near-real time, while maintaining data quality and consistency. \r\n\r\nSecond, the system must be able to normalize the data to ensure consistent data models, allowing for accurate correlation and temporal and spatial fusion of the radar and infrared camera sources. \r\n\r\nThird, the system must be designed to handle the challenges associated with radar and infrared camera data, including different formats, resolutions, and phenomenologies. Due to differing collection footprints and inconsistent collection overlap of radar and infrared cameras processing their individual data and focusing on information level fusion (e.g., knowledge graph fusion) is acceptable.\r\n\r\nFourth, the system must be able to provide decision makers with a clear, accurate, and actionable view of the UAV swarm, improving classification confidence, and enabling effective decision-making with: (a) a probability of UAV swarm detection-to-track more than 90%; (b) a classification accuracy of more than 90% across the set of UAV swarms when only trained on simulated data; (c) a probability of false alarms less than 10% at the UAV swarm detection range up to 10 km; (d) common atmospheric obscurants reducing the visible transmission coefficient at UAV swarm detection distance down to less than 10% relative to that in vacuum; (e) the UAV swarm appearing a couple of pixels wide in a dim setting; (f) techniques to automatically analyze the data associated with UAV swarm tracks, hypothesize, and make ID classification over processed spatial resolutions of 2\u201370 cm/pixel; and (g) a deep-learning model and the algorithm having a provision that allows a growing library of current and future-generation UAVs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design, document, and demonstrate feasibility of a robust deep learning-based algorithm for a fusion system of radar and MWIR and LWIR cameras of the developer\u2019s choice that meet or exceed the requirements specified in the Description. Identify the technical risk elements in the detection, identification, and tracking algorithm design for a UAV swarm of over 10 UAVs and provide viable risk mitigation strategies. Demonstrate the feasibility of the approach utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer for the algorithm to perform at a 5 Hz or higher solution rate.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, optimize, demonstrate, and deliver the fusion algorithms developed in Phase I for the selected system of radar, MWIR, and LWIR sensors for this project. The designs will then be modified as necessary to produce a final prototype. Work with the government team to test the algorithms against data collected from candidate sensors relevant to the Navy. Pertinent information will be provided to the awardee if necessary. Collect relevant training and testing data using contractor-provided UAV swarms of interest with at least 10 UAVs to validate their performance claims. Illustrate how the technology can be successfully expanded for detection, identification, and tracking of a UAV swarm of 20 to 50 UAVs against the aforementioned atmospheric and range conditions. Besides the algorithms, deliver all developed tools and data to the government.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nImplement algorithm prototypes in a realistic environment that enables thorough testing of algorithms. Incorporate applications to support testing, for example, operator displays and decision support systems. Demonstrate and validate algorithm\u2019s effectiveness. Deliver an algorithm description document, engineering code, and test cases. Explore and document other potential methodologies identified in Phase I.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Include upgrades to the analysis, M&S, and T&E results. Provide mature prototypes of radar and infrared fusion system to perform broad area search for UAV swarm in a single image. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase III goals are: \r\n\r\n(a) super-resolution processing to produce a higher resolution (HR) image from a lower resolution (LR) one with increased image content and without inducing artifacts;\r\n\r\n(b) training models focused upon consistent UAV swarm features such as spatial characteristics while giving low weight to variable characteristics like color and background;\r\n\r\n(c) create and adapt training data to build generalized broad area search target detection, classification, and tracking UAV swarm models that perform well using radar and infrared camera imagery and video;\r\n\r\n(d) collection of relevant radar and infrared camera data for training and testing machine learning models;\r\n\r\n(e) interfacing with C-UAV offensive device;\r\n\r\n(f) adapting processing capabilities for onboard edge device demonstration; \r\n\r\n(g) adding additional algorithms that optimize usage of the radar, infrared camera fusion system to operate without user input; and pursue civilian applications and additional commercialization opportunities, for example, enhanced surveillance for homeland/boarder security, identification of camouflaged/hidden targets, and nighttime facial recognition.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegarding commercialization, a potential commercial venue/application could be the commercial maritime market, where improved neighborhood awareness can increase operational safety in the oceans. In addition, this work could be applied to track anomaly detection in other domains, including air traffic management and Space Domain Awareness. The Space Domain Awareness is becoming more and more relevant, as proliferated constellations of satellites continue to grow, and it becomes more important to track debris and space objects. Commercial companies like Exo-analytics and Kratos provide space objects tracking as a service and could provide an avenue for commercialization \r\n\r\nAn additional commercialization opportunity is tracking software with increased performance for valuable application in the automotive industry, as many manufacturers are pursuing more automation and aim to fuse the information from a variety of data sources, including onboard cameras and radars.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPringle, C.

Additionally, provide some method that indicates that the active transmission is from an authentic source.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Sonar waveform watermarking embeds a digital message into an active sonar transmission so that the receiver can recover information from the transmitter, as well as conduct the usual echo detection and ranging. In future Air ASW systems, many active sonar sources will be operating in close proximity\u2014both time and space\u2014to each other. While this improves detection performance, a means of unambiguously providing detection association to a specific source will improve the system\u2019s track accuracy for a target. This SBIR topic seeks to develop a digital watermarking technology embedding information in each source ping that can be successfully interpreted at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and can assist in assigning sources to ambiguous echo detections (i.e., detection association). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis technology will reduce sonar search times by at least 25% against fast targets. Watermarking source transmissions will allow more sources to operate simultaneously and unambiguously, while maintaining a high degree of correct echo-to-source association. Watermarking technology will improve the target Area of Uncertainty (AOU) by at least 15% by increasing the number of near simultaneous detections used during target tracking.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe watermarking technology should degrade detection probabilities by less than 1 dB when operating in a wide range of ocean channel conditions, at SNR 2 dB higher than the theoretical Minimum Detectable Level (MDL). The watermarking should degrade Doppler estimation accuracy by less than 5% and range accuracy by less than 10% in realistic ocean channels that include Doppler and time spreading.\r\n\r\nThe watermarking must be applicable to narrowband waveforms such as Continuous Wave (CW) pulses, and should also be applicable to wideband waveforms such as Frequency Modulated (FM) waveforms. \r\n\r\nThe same watermarking technology can be used to embed short acoustic communication messages in active sonar transmissions that are received by other platforms in close proximity such as surface ships, and unmanned underwater vehicles even when the receiving platform is operating with high self-noise. These short acoustic communication messages can be a means to provide authentication and transmission assurance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

An Electronic Support Measure (ESM) provides the passive capability to search, intercept, collect, classify, geo-locate, monitor, copy, exploit, and disseminate these signals over a specific RF range. A key subsystem to an ESM is the RF distribution, a unit which routes the incoming RF signals to the appropriate channel for processing and analysis. Current 6U RF switches are limited in the exploitation of the frequency spectrum due to size, weight, power, and cooling (SWaPC) constraints associated with the frequency response of the components in the signal conditioning path.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis SBIR topic\u2019s goal is to develop a 16x12 non-blocking switch that operates from 1.5 MHz to 18 GHz. The proposed non-blocking RF switch should maintain present 6U SWaPC constraints. The non-blocking RF switch must be a single processing card while maintaining the following open interface standards: ANSI / VITA 46.0 VPX Baseline Standard. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe non-blocking RF switch must be able to route any of the 16 input apertures to any of the 12 output tuner channels while remaining dynamically reconfigurable via a sensor open systems architecture (SOSA).

Additional ICDs and APIs will be supplied in Phase I to develop a conceptual architecture of the RF switch. An initial design of the RF Switch is required as a product of the Phase I effort, along with initial SWaPC analysis. The Phase I Option should lay out initial design requirements for the operating bandwidth of the RF switch; the RF switch\u2019s NF, Isolation, IIP3, and P1dB; verification of operational performance requirements through modelling and simulation (M&S); and prototype plans to be further developed under Phase II (e.g., associated documentation; i.e., initial block diagram, schematic, capabilities description).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a prototype hardware and firmware solution, or engineering demonstration model (EDM), which builds upon the proposed solution and architecture developed in Phase I with a brass-board, proof-of-concept design.

The effectiveness of these systems hinges on (1) optical communication, computation, and networking components that realize high connectivity and throughput, (2) reconfigurability, (3) modularity (plug and play), (4) low-latency, (5) large link budget, and (6) compatibility with the harsh avionic environment. The traditional use of copper traces to support board-to-board communications in sensor and mission computing applications requires hundreds upon hundreds of electrical pins and a spider web of connecting copper traces. For example, the latest embedded system backplane standard, VITA 65 \u2013 OpenVPX, has connectors with 728 pins on a 6U size card and 280 pins on a 3U card, and still does not provide enough bandwidth for current or future generation systems. This situation complicates the integration of processing cards within mission computers, sensors, and imaging systems. The saturation of high-speed traces throughout the backplane can generate electrical impedance problems, creating bandwidth limitation problems [Ref 16]. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the commercial data center sector, the bandwidth capacity needs to increase along with reduced power consumption, which has increased the demand for efficient interconnects. These functions are not available with traditional interconnects, which are copper-based, thus further enhancing the utility, and in turn the need, for an optical interconnect technology refresh. Moreover, companies are innovating new solutions with multiple variants of 100 to 400 Gbps+ optical transceiver modules. Although these solutions are designed to enable network operators to address increasing bandwidth demand through simplified network architecture, these solutions are not directly compatible with the complexity of modern digital avionics networks [Ref 1]. Traditional optical implementations based on single-wavelength fiber optic transceivers operating at up to 28 Gbps per lane, 100 Gig Ethernet switches, along with the OpenVPX and Sensor Open Systems Architecture (SOSA\u2122) standards, is testing the boundaries of optical connectors and backplanes in avionics [Ref 2\u20135]. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFuture avionics signal transmission rates are expected to increase to 100 Gbps per lane and higher over 50 \u00b5 OM4/OM5 fiber. The use of high-speed digital fiber optics and wavelength division multiplexing in avionics backplanes can enable a significant increase in aggregate bandwidths beyond traditional electrical and optical networking implementation limitations. A 100 Gbps (scalable) and WDM-based optical backplane with OpenVPX capability and SOSA\u2122 compatibility will be required for future data transmission and networking in avionics [Ref 6]. As such, a high-speed WDM optical backplane for onboard avionic networking that extends beyond the current state-of-the-art technologies is desired [Ref 7\u201314]. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe proposed WDM optical backplane should minimally meet the SOSA\u2122 roadmap expectations. The proposed high-speed WDM optical backplane must operate across a -40\u00ba-+95\u00baC temperature range and maintain performance upon exposure to typical naval air platform vibration, humidity, temperature, altitude, thermal shock, mechanical shock, and temperature cycling environments [Ref 15]. The proposed approach should incorporate a quick routing capability to overcome latency and connectivity limitations and enable future avionics network architectures.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a WDM optical backplane hardware engineering design with OpenVPX capability and SOSA\u2122 compatibility. Demonstrate the feasibility of the optical backplane design and packaging. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Optimize the backplane design for future avionics networking and sensors. Build and test the optical backplane in a simulated avionics environment that is compatible with OpenVPX and SOSA\u2122. Deliver one optical backplane\u2014including active and passive components\u2014for future WDM avionics application.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support transition of the technology being developed to military aircraft platforms, commercial data center and defense avionics industries. \r\n\r\nCommercial sector telecommunication systems, fiber-optic networks, and data centers will benefit from the development of the WDM-based optical backplane such as mitigating the bandwidth limitations. These applications will be able to drive more data input at a higher speed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKultur, O. R., & Bilge, H. S. (2021, July).

The tender, submarines, and the resupply materiel will move in their own frame of reference. Precise sensing of relative pose is critical when applying automation of motion mitigation to support the tender\u2019s operations during transfers. The sensing system must operate in real-time, and accurately provide the distance to the transfer destination on the submarine, as well as the relative velocities between the two vessels in six degrees of freedom (DOF) in Sea State 3 (Objective) and 4 (Threshold). No satisfactory commercial sensing system exists currently. \r\n\r\nThe system must be operable and accurate in a marine environment, day and night, including in conditions of fog, salt spray, icing, etc. The sensors and computers performing analysis of the sensor data will be based on the tender, without excluding possibilities of establishing other temporary vantage points for transfer operations. The system must be operable at a distance to the submarine of up to 50 feet over the side of the tender, and 30 feet vertical from the location of transfer equipment on the tender. The position sensing system should also be usable for vertical lift transfers. No permanent targets or sensors may be installed on the submarine. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe system must provide an indication of when sea conditions permit safe operations for the capabilities of a given transfer method. The actual transfer method is outside the scope of this SBIR topic. A design for the sensing system is expected to enable this technology to operate on other platforms as needed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a design to address precision sensing for AS(X) submarine tenders during underway replenishment of submarines. Identify sensor choices, locations and methodology for sensor data analysis, yielding real-time 6-DOF motion identification outputs. Validate the feasibility of the approach in a marine environment by providing computer simulations or other evidence. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype system in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop a prototype system for evaluation based on the results of Phase I. Develop a test methodology to show how the technology will be evaluated to determine if the system has the potential to meet Navy performance goals described in the Phase II SOW. The goals will be defined by the Navy in Phase II. Testing in a two-body wave tank or an equivalent marine environment is expected. Develop plans for full-scale testing in an open water environment in Phase III.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. Perform full-scale testing in an open water environment and further refine the technology for Navy use.\r\n\r\nThe same technology needed to transfer supplies from tenders to submarines can also be used for other Navy ship-to-ship transfers, as well as offshore oil and wind industry applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tZiezulewicz, Geoff. \u201cNavy planning to bring back at-sea missile reload capability.\u201d Navy Times, 1 August 2017. https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2017/08/01/navy-planning-to-bring-back-at-sea-missile-reload-capability/ \r\n\t\u201cU.S. Navy Tries Reloading VLS Missile Cells With a Commercial OSV.\u201d The Maritime Executive, 7 October 2022. https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-navy-tries-reloading-vls-missile-cells-with-a-commercial-osv\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Relative Position Measurement; Underway; Inertial Measurement Unit; Precision Real Time Sensing; Sensing in Marine Environment; Cargo Transfer at Sea\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479719","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"High Reliability Flame Detector","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-023","topic_description":"","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479721","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Vertical Launch System High Speed Interface","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-024","topic_description":"","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479723","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Advanced Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Techniques for Automated Target Recognition (ATR) Using Small/Reduced Data Sets","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-025","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Sensing and Cyber; Trusted AI and Autonomy\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

In Navy mine countermeasure (MCM) operations, sensors collect data to identify and localize targets of interest in marine environments.\r\n\r\nThe Navy is interested in developing state-of-the art AI/ML ATR processing algorithms, or techniques to facilitate target detection and identification using smaller data sets to train the algorithms and perform ATR. The Navy\u2019s existing Minehunting systems collect data using forward-looking sonar, a pair of side-scan sonars, and a volume search sonar. Identification and localization of underwater objects is challenged by both a reliance on large, curated data from the onboard sensors that are needed to train and perform ATR and the amount of time required to conduct ATR operations. Current MCM ATR algorithms require large amounts of data (over 200 hours of acoustic video and 1,000-2,000 target images) to train the algorithms. This training data is quite costly to obtain because it must be collected in a variety of representative operational environments.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution should demonstrate reduction in the amount of data required to train algorithms by an order-of-magnitude smaller without degradation to identification performance (Pid) and no increase in the Probability of false alarms (Pfa). If possible, the solution should incorporate advanced ML techniques such as One Shot, Multi Shot, Few Shot etc. as well as others that yield the benefits sought. \r\n\r\nThe ATR will be initially integrated into the Navy\u2019s Generalized ATR (GATR) framework to improve detection and classification performance. The capability could eventually be integrated into a towed body to support in-stride ATR.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

These sensors will provide both wide field of view (WFOV) and narrow field of view (NFOV) video imaging across a full 360\u00b0 in both visible and infrared (IR) bands. Imagery from these cameras has a variety of uses from navigation to target detection, identification, and tracking. WFOV cameras will cue potential targets of interest to NFOV cameras which will then center on the target location for higher resolution inspection of the target. Therefore, knowing the axis along which each camera is looking, relative to a common reference (the position of the camera on the vessel) is critical in sensor coordination and cueing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe optical axis of an imaging sensor normal to the center point of its focal plane, or a NFOV reticle at or near the center, is its boresight. The optical axis of laser devices, such as a NFOV rangefinder, must also be boresight aligned with the imaging sensor reticle in order to receive reflected energy from the intended target. The mechanical mount and positioning structure of the sensor serves to point the optical axis in the desired location. However, mechanical tolerances naturally cause a difference between the mechanical axis of the sensor\u2019s mount and the true optical axis. For deployed sensors, ship vibration and harsh environmental conditions can cause alignment to degrade over time. Calibration to correct or compensate for misalignment of the optical and mechanical axes is known as boresight alignment. Therefore, boresight alignment applies across multiple elements to include the imaging sensors, laser(s), and line-of-sight (LOS) pointing by the director mount. Boresight alignment is an important step in preparing the sensor for deployment and it is particularly critical for NFOV, high magnification cameras. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMechanical and optical alignment of the Navy\u2019s optical sensor modules, known as line replaceable units (LRUs), is typically done in the factory or some centralized Government facility, both when the sensor is newly manufactured and after depot overhaul of the system. When the system is installed on a ship as an assembly, or following organizational level maintenance of the LRUs of a LOS director, the combination of factory alignment and mechanical tolerances is insufficient to ensure alignment across imaging sensor, laser, and LOS director elements. This results in manual, labor intensive processes that require skilled technicians to execute differing procedures across multiple systems. The current process also requires the ship to be in port with distant objects within view and is not practicable while the ship is underway. Therefore, if alignment could be performed in-place utilizing automated processes and a minimum of additional equipment, the current difficulties of calibration could be eliminated, thereby resulting in a reduced mean time to repair and significant cost savings. In addition, performance of the imaging system could be maintained while underway as environmentally induced misalignment could be periodically corrected or compensated for.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy needs a technique (realized in software and hardware) for in-situ boresight alignment of optical imaging sensors (cameras) and rangefinders. There is no current capability commercially available. Techniques that generate an offset table for registration of the imagery to the baseline frame of reference are acceptable. The technique must also be useful for cameras operating in the IR spectra as well as the visible spectrum. The solution must be applicable to imaging sensors where multiple focal plane arrays use the same aperture as well as systems that have co-located but separate apertures. Most Navy systems of interest incorporate lasers that operate in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) for range finding so the solution should include the facility to calibrate in conjunction with the laser (which also may be subject to misalignment). The visible, near infrared (NIR), SWIR, and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) bands are of most interest however, a technique that could be extended to the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is attractive.\r\n\r\nThe technique should provide boresight alignment to an accuracy of 100 micro-radians or better. Solutions that require a minimum amount of added hardware (hardware added either permanently to the sensor baseline or installed temporarily for the calibration process) are desired. Likewise, the solution should be largely automatic, requiring no more skill or human intervention for calibration than typically required of the operator during normal system operation. A technology that requires no added hardware and is fully automated, if feasible and sufficiently precise, represents a full solution to the problem. Solutions that require the cooperation of other vessels or aircraft, solutions that are only feasible in certain locations of the ocean (e.g., along known coastlines), and solutions that can only be deployed to specific ship classes or require extensive modification of the vessel are not of interest. Solutions that make use of two or more imaging sensors (either co-located or not) working together are potentially acceptable, although it should be noted that the feasibility decreases rapidly as the number of cooperating sensors required for calibration goes up. For this effort, NFOV cameras are of primary interest. However, the fundamentals of the technique should be extensible to any format and magnification imaging system.\r\n\r\nNote that the Navy does not intend to furnish tactical or otherwise representative imaging system hardware for this effort. The proposed solution should therefore include the means for test and demonstration on surrogate hardware, provided as part of the solution. A prototype (hardware and software) of the technology will be delivered to NSWC Crane Division at the conclusion of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

This includes general observation of the surroundings for purposes of navigation, specific search for objects both airborne and in the water, identification of other vessels, and target acquisition and tracking for weapons systems. WFOV cameras are typically used for navigation and general situational awareness while narrow-field of view (NFOV) cameras are used for target tracking and identification as well as scanning specific sectors of ocean and sky, searching for particular (and usually very small or very distant) targets. Both types of cameras require stabilization to compensate for ship motion and the buffeting effect of wind and wave during heavy sea states. NFOV cameras are almost always deployed on stabilized gimbal mounts that respond quickly to ship motion in the three axes of roll, pitch, and yaw. These cameras are used to move to a specific target cue or coordinate. Once a target is within view, these systems can employ feedback for stabilization or use inputs from inertial sensors to maintain target tracking.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWFOV cameras are very often used in \u201cstaring\u201d mode. In this mode of operation, the camera does not scan or move to a target cue. The camera stares in a pre-defined direction (with respect to the platform), whether a target is present or not. In panoramic applications, multiple WFOV cameras can be assigned individual sectors of coverage and the composite image stitched together. In this way, even full 360\u00b0 coverage can be achieved. However, this presents particular problems not experienced by NFOV systems. In general, WFOV imaging systems are typically larger than NFOV sensors, especially for multi-spectral systems, and their greater mass requires larger mounts and greater power input if active stabilization is to be used. In systems with 360\u00b0 coverage and stitched panoramic output, the mount may be somewhat simplified since effects of ship yaw can be compensated for electronically. However, ship pitch and roll are extremely detrimental to the image quality as they inhibit proper stitching of the image and lead to images with a constantly moving horizon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy is fielding a suite of imaging sensors with unprecedented capability. These sensors will provide both WFOV and NFOV video imaging across a full 360\u00b0 in both visible and infrared (IR) bands. Adequate stabilization technology exists for the NFOV sensors. However, the WFOV sensors present a particular challenge, as described above. The Navy needs a stabilization technology for large WFOV sensors that achieve 360\u00b0 panoramic imaging through sector coverage. Currently there is no commercial capability that can meet the requirements. The desire is to provide imagery that can be efficiently processed (for example, through stitching) and achieves a stable horizon for easy viewing. Electronic stabilization cannot provide a solution in high sea states, so a mechanical solution is required. This is further complicated by the design of the sensor, which packages multiple cameras and apertures into a single unit.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of initial design and demonstration, the full sensor package to be stabilized can be viewed as a rectilinear \u201cbox\u201d, approximately 65 inches across the face, 42 inches deep, and 29 inches high. The box has a weight not to exceed 560 lbs and a center of mass at the true center of the box. The sensor package covers a 135\u00b0 sector of the vessel. The sensor package defined by this box\u2019s dimensions must be stabilized for ship motion in \u00b120\u00b0 roll and pitch displacement, 7.5\u00b0/sec roll and pitch velocity and 5.0\u00b0/sec2 roll and pitch acceleration (with \u00b140\u00b0 roll and pitch displacement, 20\u00b0/sec roll and pitch velocity and 10\u00b0/sec2 roll and pitch acceleration as an objective). Stabilization to a minimum accuracy of 25 mirco-radians (15 micro-radians as an objective) in elevation is required. As an objective, the sensor package should also meet stabilization requirements while experiencing the vibration levels in MIL-STD-810H table 528.1-I. A solution that presents the minimum size, weight, and power (SWaP) necessary to achieve the required stabilization accuracy is desired. While the dimensions, weight, and center of mass listed above define the Navy\u2019s current need, a solution that is extensible to both larger and smaller packages with variation in the center of mass represents a solution with broad utility that is highly desirable. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that the Navy does not intend to furnish tactical or otherwise representative imaging system hardware for this effort. The proposed solution should therefore include the means for test and demonstration on surrogate hardware, provided as part of the solution. A prototype (hardware and software) of the technology will be delivered to NSWC Crane Division at the conclusion of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

The equipment used to spray the UHS coatings consist of a single or plural component mix pneumatic pumping/proportioning unit, in-line heaters for viscosity control, high pressure hoses and static mixers followed by a spray whip connected to a spray gun. Because of the viscosity of the UHS coatings system, it is typical for heat to be applied by the inline heaters to reduce the viscosity to achieve a properly atomized spray pattern at the tip of the spray gun. Various spray tips are used as well to properly atomize the spray fan or cone shape of the coating being delivered to the surface being painted. The current systems deliver the coating at high pressure and high volume, which causes difficulty in controlling film build and spread during application. For most of the work performed where UHS systems are employed, the result of coating application does not require a finished surface akin to an evenly spread, uniformly thick coating without surface flaws. \r\n\r\nIn an ever-growing need, the maintenance community relies on MIL-PRF-23236 Type VII UHS coatings for corrosion control in areas where legacy thin film coatings were historically applied in multiple thin layers to achieve the desired surface finishes and thickness. Transitioning to UHS coating applications increased the difficulty of achieving the surface finish and increased dry film thickness (DFT) that affect ship component fit of covers, plates, and other equipment assemblies in new ship designs. Controlling the volume of flow and spray pattern of UHS coatings in many applications will dramatically improve production efficiency when preserving naval assets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDeveloping a spray gun that can achieve adequate volume and tailored spray capabilities is not trivial. To achieve the atomized spray desired, the developmental spray gun will have to control incoming pressures up to 7250 psi (50MPa), meter coating volume to a level to achieve control of spray atomization, pattern, and thickness control while allowing sufficient flow and productions levels as not to allow the rapid cure nature of the UHS coating to solidify within the application equipment past the static mix blocks or in the lines due to too slow coating deposition. The gun should be light enough for use by the applicator for long periods, handle the heat generated by fluid temperatures used to modify coating viscosities, and be able to spray coating film metered between 2 \u2013 10 min/max mils wet film thickness, (WFT) per pass with an average targeted range of 2 \u2013 5 mils per pass by an applicator. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExisting UHS spray technology is not well suited for applications where highly detailed work is required. Technologically advanced structures continue to be developed for marine service using light weight corrosion prone materials in seawater. When the structure being coated is geometrically complex, it becomes difficult to apply coatings properly and with any level of detail. Developing the capability to tailor spray parameters will provide significant advantages for controlling the application of UHS coatings, providing the asset with the necessary corrosion protection and functionality to operate as intended in a highly corrosive seawater marine environment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Naval Research Enterprise (NRE) produced an in-house prototype spray gun using existing commercially available gun bodies and was successful at achieving and demonstrating basic spray capabilities. However, the prototype was highly dangerous as the components were not designed for such high fluid pressures. Additionally, the ability to fully realize the desired performance of the gun itself was never met. Development was necessary with respect to flow, volume control, and atomization behavior of the coating. The science behind the operation and thus the ability to tailor to a wide range of spray conditions were not addressed since a production problem with a new Navy asset necessitated a hastily designed and constructed spray gun prototype for just that application. NRE engineers surveyed commercial industry manufacturers that supply coating equipment and were not able to identify such a spray gun with the desired capabilities. Discussions with equipment manufacturers indicated they had no desire to invest in such a design since their customer base was satisfied with the existing technology. However, as with the development of UHS coatings, the Navy\u2019s need drove UHS development, and the commercial sector followed suit as the demand began to increase. It is likely the same process will play out for this effort. When applicators who routinely use UHS systems have an alternative spray gun that allows them to control their application parameters to a higher degree, the equipment manufacturers will likely follow suit. The Navy currently has several designs for autonomous vehicles in operation and under development which require controlled coating applications. Over the past few years, the need has grown significantly.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo properly spray high solids/rapid cure coatings, a balance of pump pressure, temperature, flow rates, distance from pump, and a host of other factors need to be met. Existing commercial products are designed to meet a wide range of capabilities. However, the need to restrict many of these parameters will cause significant issues and are counter to how both the equipment and coatings were designed for use. R&D and innovation is needed to address how to change the parameters to achieve desired properties; (tightly controllable surface thickness and finish) over a wide variety of applications where a high-volume coating is being applied in a low volume situation without affecting coating cure properties or performance. Additionally, a new spray gun must be developed to ensure applicators can safely apply the coatings which are under high pressure metered down to some working pressure while having the ability to adjust the spray to geometrically complex structures in the field. The Navy needs a method to apply existing high-performance coatings in a way to achieve asset operation that supports asset design.\r\n\r\nOn average, the cost of such equipment is dictated by the complexity of the design, required machining, and availability of incorporated parts. Sales of spray guns assumed to be within the same complexity of design range from $3K to $7K each. The design should weigh no more than a comparable style commercial gun because weight and balance affect the applicator\u2019s ability to spray for long durations. Physical weight should not exceed 3 lbs. and fall within a box 8\u201d W X 8\u201d L X 2.5\u201d D dimensionally. In addition, the design should account for ease of use when spraying in tight geometries, for example, in a rectangle that is 12\u201d W X 14\u201d D X 72\u201d L. Supply lines for fluid and potentially compressed air should be attached in a way that they allow flexibility at the applicator\u2019s wrist. The gun should be able to sustain continuous spray for several hours at a time, and not suffer from any internal erosion of moving parts or fluid pathways.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo date no Commercial Item Description, (CID) exists for such a spray gun. CID A-A-50310 is a spray gun CID however it is not applicable to this design and should not be used as a reference. However, the pumping system to which the gun will attached falls under the CID A-A-59780 accessible through Assist Online at Defense Logistics Agency https://quicksearch.dla.mil/quicksearch.aspx. During the demonstration phase, the prototype gun will be attached to a plural spray pump that meets this CID. Coatings that will be sprayed through this prototype are qualified to MIL-PRF-23236, Type VII, Class 5, 5/18, 7, 7/18, &13 Grade C. All the specifications listed are available as Distribution A to the public and can be found at the DLA quick search website mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe product shall be a packaged spray gun with all the necessary components for operation and connectivity to plural component spray equipment, like that of existing commercial spray gun sales. If adapters or any component deemed proprietary is needed for use, it shall be included in the end products inventory. The company identified for commercialization shall have the ability to provide repair and maintenance components and services as necessary to support end user needs. Beyond the immediate need for GFE components, the military industrial complex has immediate needs for coating specific equipment and designs for UHS coatings that require detailed spray capabilities. Those organizations both government and commercial will require this equipment. In addition, some of those commercial entities rely heavily on outside commercial coating applicator companies to perform the applications. Many of these companies also perform routine maintenance on military assets e.g., surface ships, submarines, barges, etc., and will likely adopt the use of this product to other activities as it will improve their ability to provide a level of control over the process they struggle to manage. In many instances coating appearances plays a larger role in acceptance of the final coating product, than intended coating performance. Coatings companies strive to perfect the applications so the job can be accepted by the owners of the assets they were hired to coat.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Define and develop a concept for an UHS delivery system that meets the specifications identified in the Description. Modeling and simulation should be used to articulate the feasibility of the design features and functionality, and to provide a computerized working model and detailed diagrams. The concept for a working prototype shall be at a level so that prototype construction and operation methodology are well defined. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will require the small business to provide a written report detailing the design concept, proposed functionality, construction methodology and materials, and marketing strategy to develop the desired product. The report shall include the initial design drawings and specifications with sufficient detail to complete construction of the working prototype in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a working spray gun prototype that meets the requirements detailed in the Description. The prototype will be required to function as designed and be demonstrate using a plural component proportioning pump like that used in industry. Recommendations will be made to identify such equipment if necessary. Demonstrate performance in house prior to demonstrating to the government. Upon completion of the government demonstration, the prototype shall be delivered to the government for additional testing if the prototype has met the performance criteria. A total of four prototypes units will be required to be constructed for field testing at industrial sites specified by the Topic Author.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to transition from prototype to full production. In the early stages the Phase III product will initially role out to specific Navy organizations that currently require coatings applications which are driving the spray gun development. The spray gun will be introduced into the system that supports GFE. It will be through this effort that the Navy will validate performance during complete preservation of GFE components and certify it for Navy use. \r\n\r\nCommercial interest will be driven by the need for controlled coating application where high volume deposition fails. The polyurea/insulation community has high volume and low volume spray guns (e.g., GX-7 vs GX-8 respectively) where controlling the volume of coating being deposited is driven by application requirements and type. Industrial coating application such as refineries and chemical plants where complex structure is involved would benefit from tighter application controls to reduce overspray and film build. It would also reduce the cost of materials through wastage.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSanchez-Amaya, J.M., Osun, R.M., Bethencourt M., and Botana, F.J. \u201cMonitoring the degredation of a high solids epoxy coating by means of EIS and EN.\u201d Science Direct Progress in Organic Coatings Volume 60, Issue 3, October 2007: 248-254. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.porgcoat.2007.07.020\r\n\tWebb, Martin, Groeninger, Slebonick, Lucas, and Hogan. \u201cReducing Corrosion Control Cost with Rapid-Cure Coatings.\u201d Naval Research Laboratory Review 2007: 63-69\r\n\tMIL-PRF-23236D AMD/1 March 2023, via Assist Online Quick Search https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsSearch.aspx using Document number 23236\r\n\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: UHS thin film deposition; Airless spray guns; UHS coatings application; Marine coating anticorrosive coatings; Tunable spray atomization and thickness control; Low volume rapid cure spray gun\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479733","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Advanced Acoustic Hailing","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-029","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems; Integrated Sensing and Cyber\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Identify and develop advanced acoustic hailing systems to provide a highly effective alternative for embarked security teams that encounter non-responsive boats and craft.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Acoustic Hailing systems are prevalent in the security industry, especially with law enforcement and Commercial Cargo Ships. However, marinized capabilities scaled for U.S. Navy boats and combatant craft do not currently satisfy size/weight requirements; small craft have limited weight, space, and power which require systems to fit within the load bearing capabilities of 34 to 40 foot craft. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks to develop an Acoustic Hailing system that has utility in operation of 34 ft, 40 ft and similar U.S. Navy boats and combatant craft. Proposed deterrent systems will be required to keep a steady low angle beam on target from a distance up to 1000 meters and be effective within all environments, conditions, and regions that Expeditionary boats and craft operate. A successful deterrent system would allow embarked security teams to have a concept of operations that does not require that they enter an approaching craft\u2019s threat zone, reducing the risk to personnel on both sides by providing an annoying and clearly audible deterrent sound out to 1,000 meters in open water. A marinized Acoustic Hailing system will complement the operational profile of small boats/craft, which can include extreme environmental conditions in which the U.S. Navy operates. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIntelligibility criteria for the Acoustic Hailing voice communication should be minimally at the normal acceptable intelligibility, i.e., about 98% of sentences are correctly heard with single digits understood. The modified rhyme test, phonetically balanced word test and articulation index/speech transmission index are incorporated in the intelligibility criteria.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a marinized advanced acoustic hailing system for a relevant vessel similar to a U.S. Navy 34 to 40 foot Patrol Boat that meets the requirements in the Description. Demonstrate the feasibility of the operational concept via physics-based modeling and simulation. Define the proposed components of the system hull, mechanical and electrical interfaces, to include power sources as well as any additional functioning design concepts of the system. Provide a preliminary concept design and an associated component validation plan. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype Acoustic Hailing system capable of being integrated with a U.S. Navy 34 to 40 foot Patrol Boat. Evaluate the prototype to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II SOW and the Navy requirements for the 34 to 40 foot Patrol Boats. Demonstrate system performance through prototype evaluation and testing, modeling, and analysis. Evaluate results and accordingly refine the deterrent system concept. Ensure that the prototyped hardware clearly shows a path to development of a marinized system. The prototype model is to be made available for Government demonstration or testing, as required. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology to Navy use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the fully hardened Acoustic Hailing system for Navy use to include demonstration/sea trials on a relevant vessel. Support for participation in fleet demonstration is aimed at transition with the intent to purchase and integrate the system into the U.S. Navy Patrol Boat Fleet. \r\n\r\nA deterrent system of this type should benefit any number of working craft in the fishing, oil, or research industries operating in open water or contested environments.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\u201cAcoustic Hailing Device (AHD) SBIR requirements\u201d https://navysbir.com/n24_1/NAVSEA-Acoustic_Hailing_Device-24_1.pdf\r\n\tBarrett, Benjamin K, LCDR USN, Naval War College Department of Joint Military Operations, \u201cThe Utility of Non-Lethal Weapons in Large-Scale Conflict\u201d, 8 Feb 2000, https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA379171.pdf \r\n\tAllison, Graham T., Paul X.

The current paradigm for training AI/ML is to use large sets of data. However, the cost associated with training AI/ML on large amounts of data is high and may not result in optimal training results.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is not currently a commercial tool to assess how comprehensive a training set truly is, how much of the training data is effectively redundant, or whether some data over-represents unusual conditions. Additionally, there is not currently a tool that would enable researchers to determine a priori whether a newly collected data set would add useful diversity to the existing training data. This lack of tools for assessing training data for AI/ML algorithms results in a current state where all data is collected for training, resulting in possible excessive training costs as well as possible over-training to specific data which may not be representative of the full range of conditions in which the system will function during hostile tactical operations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks a tool for analysis of acoustic data collected by undersea warfare systems to enable selection of data that is diverse, representative, and as small as practical for training of AI/ML algorithms.\r\n\r\nAcoustic data used for detection of submarines is collected on arrays of transducers, whether towed line receive arrays such as the Multi-Function Towed Array, or hull-mounted source/receiver arrays such as the 576-element AN/SQS-53C hull-mounted sonar array. The signals from the transducers are formed into beams representing the acoustic environment as a function of bearing at any given point in time. Key characteristics of data sets will include both meta-data (e.g., season, latitude and longitude, time of day) and attributes of the data (e.g., volume reverberation levels, numbers of \u201cclusters\u201d associated with reflectors such as bathymetric features, marine entities, surface ships, submarines, and wakes).\r\n\r\nThe tool developed will need to demonstrate the training data prioritization technology which reduces the amount of training data used to allow the AI/ML algorithm(s) to maintain or improve performance. Performance of the system is determined by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, where recorded data is run through the system to determine the number of true positives are achieved as a function of false positives.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified. Note: The prospective contractor(s) must be U.S. owned and operated with no foreign influence as defined by 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 2004.20 et seq., National Industrial Security Program Executive Agent and Operating Manual, unless acceptable mitigating procedures can and have been implemented and approved by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) formerly Defense Security Service (DSS). The selected contractor must be able to acquire and maintain a secret level facility and Personnel Security Clearances. This will allow contractor personnel to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement.

If the unclassified data is not acoustic data, then it must be clearly extensible to the acoustic data use case. Feasibility will be demonstrated through analysis and modeling. Demonstrate the ROC curve associated with training on all data and how the ROC curve is maintained or even improved when AI/ML is trained using the prioritized subset of all data. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design, develop, and deliver a prototype AI/ML training data prioritization tool for testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I.

One of the main challenges associated with deployment of AgO/Zn battery cells is the lack of a reliable and accurate way to measure the battery\u2019s state of charge, state of health and remaining useful life at any stage of application/in-situ. Currently, the AgO/Zn battery (up to 120 cells in series) set assembled with 365 ampere hour (Ahr) capacity is de-commissioned based on the pre-determined wet-life duration instead of cell state-of-health due to a lack of commercial ability to assess state-of-health without extensive analysis or destructive testing. This results in potentially healthy batteries being removed from service before the end of useful life. The Navy is seeking a man-portable (preferably hand-held or laptop installed) Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) tool that can detect early signs of battery degradation and predict the remaining useful life of AgO/Zn batteries, other, application and scalability to additional battery chemistries are also desired. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA TMDE tool would result in cost reduction, risk reductions, and better sustainment of fleet underwater vehicles by removing batteries from fleet once a \u2018true\u2019 End of Service Life was met based on battery condition versus timed maintenance. It would achieve these benefits by allowing maintenance activities to provide requisite Objective Quality Evidence (OQE) to determine life extensions, informing maintainers of the real-time battery conditions that indicate a thermal event, allowing operators and maintainers to make more informed and safer decisions, and enable targeted replacement of weak cells in a battery set instead of replacing the entire battery set. The latter would increase the life of a battery set, thereby reducing the amount of battery sets needed to be purchased and increasing operational availability. The former would reduce schedule risks when planning and conducting operations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe tool developed must be non-destructive and user-friendly with a graphical user interface (GUI) to display metrics to accurately describe battery condition. It should utilize advanced sensor technologies to assess the state-of-health and remaining useful life of AgO/Zn battery sets prior to deployment, transport, maintenance, or storage. If the device is handheld, it should be battery powered by 20VDC or less, and rechargeable using standard 110VAC.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a portable Battery Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment tool that meets the requirements in the Description. Establish feasibility by developing system diagrams as well as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models that show the tool\u2019s design concept, and provide estimated weight and dimensions of the concept. Feasibility will also be established by computer-based simulations that show the system\u2019s capabilities are suitable for the Navy\u2019s needs. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and fabricate a prototype for demonstration and characterization of key parameters of the TDME tool as detailed in the Description. Conduct a prototype demonstration capable of full-scale operation according to the design. Complete relevant testing to prove the full-scale metrics. Based on lessons learned through the prototype demonstration, develop a substantially complete design to allow for Navy integration. Ensure that this design includes all ancillary equipment required to operate components such as the TMDE tool and control software when applicable to the proposed concept.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology for Navy use. Although a fully operational TMDE tool is initially targeted for use in maintenance and sustainment of underwater vehicles, it should have the ability to support additional battery chemistries and be suitable for shipboard use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe TMDE tool could be useful in commercial applications where safe, high energy density batteries are used.

Erosion has been an antagonist for the ACV industry for many years. In operation, ACVs produce high airflow rates at speeds up to 300 mph across mostly composite components and surfaces. This massive amount of air flow can be saturated with saltwater and sand particulates. ACV components are also exposed to constant vibrations, high winds, impacts, and other foreign object debris. ACVs require erosion protection to cover large internal composite surfaces while minimizing both cost of acquisition and manpower for installation and maintenance. After a comprehensive survey of the industry, multiple commercial products have been attempted with no viable solution found. The internal flow surfaces on the craft that must be preserved from erosion include the bow thruster nozzle, upper lift fan volute, lower lift fan volute, propulsor shroud, propulsor stators, and rudders. As each component is custom and designed specific to its location, it must maintain its shape and composition. Figures and dimensions of these components can be found in Reference 4 linked below. The Navy has researched and evaluated multiple erosion coatings and tapes with marginal success in the harsh environment. Current solutions are difficult to apply and repair in the field. The Navy is seeking an optimized erosion protection solution to decrease maintenance and inspection intervals on all ACV composite surfaces, increasing mission efficiency and readiness. This product solution should be manageable for the onsite maintainers to reapply and repair when needed, including inside an amphibious ship\u2019s well deck or on an isolated beach in a deployed environment. A successful coating technology must bond to all contact surfaces and not present the possibility of separating or delaminating, causing further damage to other components. A solution that meets all ACV erosion requirements would result in lowered overall maintenance effort and cost.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for erosion prevention for ACVs that meets the requirements as described above. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concept in meeting Navy needs. Demonstrate that the durable erosion prevention application can be readily and cost-effectively manufactured through standard industry practices by material testing and analytical modeling. The Phase I Option, if exercised, should include the initial layout and capabilities to demonstrate the application in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of the Phase I effort and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and deliver an erosion prevention application that meets the requirements in the Description. A production representative application will be installed on an actual ACV component or appropriate test platform for durability and wear testing. The technology will be evaluated and compared to other erosion prevention methods to determine its ability to meet specified requirements. These evaluation results will be used to refine the erosion prevention application into a design that will meet ACV Craft Specifications. Prepare a Phase III development plan and cost analysis to transition the technology to Navy use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the erosion prevention application for use on the ACV program. The satisfactory ACV erosion prevention method will have private sector and commercial potential for hovercrafts of this scale operating in the near-shore or on-shore environment, which are all currently struggling with erosion prevention.

The Deployment System should be capable of deploying an encased A-Sized Sonobuoy and an encased extended A-sized sonobuoy form factor payload roughly the size of a cylinder 5.5 inches in diameter and 48 inches of length with a weight of 40 pounds. When deployed, the case (e.g., sonobuoy launch container) shall be left behind in the deployment system. Currently, there is no commercial technology that meets this requirement.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Deployment System must be designed to be modular/reconfigurable such that it is capable of deploying 1 to 16 A-sized or extended A-sized sonobuoy form factor payloads depending on the platform\u2019s available payload space. It must also not interfere with operations of the vessel and must be capable of deploying explosive payloads. For the purposes of this SBIR topic, deploy can mean released, launched, propelled or dropped in the water. However, the payload deploying mechanism must result in a consistent, repeatable, and safe separation of the payload. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt its maximum configurable size (16 payloads) the deployment system shall deploy each payload at a minimum distance of 3 plus or minus 0.5 meters. At its minimum configurable size (1 payload), the deployment system shall deploy each payload at a minimum distance of 0.5 plus or minus 0.1 meters.\r\n\r\nAt its maximum configurable size (16 payloads), the deployment system must be capable of integrating on the deck of a vessel with a maximum footprint of 238 inches by 70 inches, a deck load of 3,400 pounds and electrical power of 28 VDC at 25 A supplied by the vessel. Coordination with NAVSEA will be critical to understanding the most current available space(s) aboard other platforms, crafts and vessels of opportunity, as well as any weight/power restrictions on the Deployment System. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Deployment System must be simple enough in design to allow for sustained operations and must be capable of at least 100 deployments before repair or refurbishment with high reliability and little maintenance down time for 24 hour/7 day surge periods. The Deployment System must also include a communications interface. While a communications package is not part of this topic, the deployment system should be capable of interfacing with a data communications system. The interface is intended to provide a mechanism for future unmanned or autonomous deployment. The system shall adhere to all applicable environmental standards of the latest version of MIL-STD-810, such as shock, vibration, electromagnetic interference/emission, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

Kinetic effectors (hardkill) such as missiles, naval guns, or other types of projectiles defeat targets primarily using kinetic energy alone or with the assistance of energetics to physically damage or destroy the target, rendering it harmless as a threat. The effects of a kinetic engagement are generally straightforward to observe, and may include rapid changes of trajectory, observing a single target becoming many smaller targets, detection of explosions, inability to reacquire the target after impact, and many others. In short, the effects are typically easily observable using typical Naval sensor suites. A limitation of kinetic effectors is that they are limited in number, and once expended, are not easily replenished in the heart of a battle. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nConversely, electromagnetic (EM) engagements (softkill), such as those accomplished through lasers, high power microwaves, other radio frequency (RF) sources, or other electronic attack mechanisms, can be much more subtle in their effects and may not be directly observable by naval sensor suites. Where kinetic weapons like missiles typically take time to travel to the target, but once there, achieve a near-instantaneous effect, EM engagements may start immediately (think of applying laser energy to a target), but may take some amount of time to accomplish their purpose (that is, laser dwell time on a spot to burn a hole). Some EM effects may be observable, such as in the case of a laser burning a hole in the flight control surfaces of an unmanned aerial vehicle, causing it to plummet to the water below. Others, such as RF energy, may be achieving an effect to prevent the target from acquiring its target, but from outside observation, the target is still behaving nominally. EM effectors, unlike kinetic effectors, are not inherently limited to a finite number of shots, and therefore may represent a greater number of engagement opportunities than their kinetic analogs. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA challenge for naval forces is achieving efficient expenditure of effectors to balance adequate self-protection with mission completion. EM effectors offer the promise of defeating threats without the expenditure of limited kinetic effectors, which can then be preserved for the most stressing threats. The ability to defeat threats with a mix of kinetic and EM effectors opens the possibility of optimizing the use of engagement resources to defeat the greatest number of threats while prolonging the amount of time the force can stay in the fight. This is only possible if the predicted effectiveness of a weapon can be determined and the actual effect against a live target can be assessed in real-time. Herein lies the challenge inherent to EM weapons, and subsequently the challenge in effective kinetic/EM coordination. To effectively make use of EM weapons, the warfighter (or the combat system acting on the warfighter\u2019s behalf) must be able to determine if the EM weapon being employed is achieving the desired effect. The greater confidence the warfighter has that the weapon will achieve the intended effect against the target, the more likely he or she is to rely on it in real circumstances. Similarly, in live operations, the ability to confidently determine whether the EM weapon is being effective on an engagement-by-engagement basis is critical to efficient and effective employment of coordinated kinetic/EM engagements. Currently, there is no commercial means to make this assessment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy needs a means by which to assess in real time the softkill effectiveness expectation that EM weapons are having against a threat to make decisions about whether additional engagement resources may be needed. Moreover, confidence in the predicted effectiveness of EM weapons as well as the real-time performance may even lead to warfighter decisions to employ them first, ostensibly preserving kinetic effectors. This tradeoff is a challenge when conducting engagements from a single ship, and only grows more complex as we scale to the Integrated Combat System (ICS) vision of force-level engagement coordination of kinetic and EM effects. An automated TES-EE is needed to determine how real-time effectiveness of EM engagements can be consistently determined and provided to the warfighter across the spectrum of naval EM weapons (e.g., directed energy, electronic attack, high-power RF/microwave, etc.). An operator must be able to confidently rely on the effectiveness of data being provided in order to make decisions regarding employment of supplemental weapons for the engagement. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe solution will leverage all available sensor and data feeds available on a surface ship to assess effectiveness of EM Effectors and communicate that to the ICS as a success/no-success or percent chance of success assessment of the desired EM Effector intent. Effectiveness assessments should be presented to operators as a combination of an \u2018alert\u2019 and relevant data for each effector engagement pairing via current operator graphical user interfaces and may leverage updates to display architectures planned by ICS. Transition is expected to be via the ICS program, notionally as a hosted application, service, or container(s) as best supports the implementation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe solution will provide a description of mechanisms for assessing the real-time performance of EM Effectors (such as SLQ-32(V)7, LEED, NULKA, etc.) against nominal threats in the context of a surface Navy combat system. Additionally, the Government desires a System Modeling Language (SysML) model and sufficient views to represent the TES-EE concept that captures necessary TES-EE inputs and system responses agnostic to a specific combat system and analyses to quantify expected impacts to self-defense performance and potential confidence bounds associated with EM versus kinetic weapon expenditures.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe TES-EE prototype will demonstrate software algorithms, present EM real-time effectiveness data to the warfighter supporting tactical decision making, provide data and associated analyses demonstrating kinetic weapon expenditure reduction through effective EM weapon employment, a software design model of the prototype TES-EE with traceability to the system model, and a white paper describing the prototype TES-EE\u2019s extensibility to supporting force-level (multiple ships acting in concert) engagements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

In a review of data regarding the Well Deck Watch Stations training, it becomes clear that there is a need to standardize and enhance the existing training approach. The current process involves On-the-Job Training (OJT) along with a Personal Qualification Standard (PQS) and Job Qualification Requirements (JQR). However, additional training is sought to maximize effective OJT. The establishment of a training continuum. either virtual or on a scaled temporary on demand basis. that emphasizes performance in a controlled environment is required to support expeditionary readiness.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA Well Deck Line Handler Trainer would be part of a training continuum utilized prior to conducting training/operations aboard Naval shipping at sea, so that time and training value can be maximized. The Well Deck Operations Trainer, either virtual or on a scaled temporary on demand basis, shall provide live form and function capabilities associated with well deck operations to meet individual and collective training standards. The proposed solution should provide line handlers, supervisors, and small craft operators an opportunity to train under realistic conditions in a controlled environment before underway operations on an L-class ship. The well deck, as much as possible, shall replicate the material and working conditions of an L-Class ship to prepare individuals and crews for live shipboard operations. The LPD 17 Class well deck is 188 feet long and approximately 50 feet wide at mid well, increasing to 59 feet at the sill, or stern of the ship. Vertical clearance in the well is 31 feet. The trainer should be able to replicate ballasting requirements for various craft to include maximum 8-10 ft at the sill for LCU operations. To support training requirements, the Well Deck Operations Trainer should provide embark and debark procedures that replicate recovery and emergency procedures for craft expected to conduct wet well operations. The trainer should include a catwalk where line handlers are stationed, as well as replication of day and night operations. Training should be structured to replicate skill components required of the integrated working environment utilizing the building block approach. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe culmination of block training would be conducting line-handling duties aboard L-class shipping under normal operating conditions. The phased approach is a cost-effective solution that maximizes prime time skills development ensuring a high level of competency.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe design, development, and implementation of a Well Deck Trainer will provide a location for teams to train, rehearse, and refine Required Operational Capabilities and Projected Operational Environment (ROC/POE) and Mission Essential Tasks (METs) that directly relate to amphibious requirements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a conceptual design to meet the requirements in the Description. Through modeling and simulation, or other means, demonstrate the feasibility to develop a concept that meets the needs of the Navy. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the results of Phase I efforts and the Phase II Statement of Work (SOW), develop and deliver a prototype. Demonstrate the capability of the prototype to recover and secure an LCU in a controlled environment incorporating line-handling practices. Construct one task trainer prototype for testing. Support the Navy for test and validation in accordance with Navy regulations and requirements. Navy technical leads will validate the prototype to ensure compliance with training certification requirements. Refine the design of the Well Deck Operations Trainer for the training and qualification of line handlers and small craft/boat crews to conduct wet well procedures.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. Following testing and validation, implement the final prototype at multiple sites in Fleet concentration areas. \r\n\r\nThis technology will help the Navy meet the critical needs of increased warfighting capability for L-Class ships and expand the Amphibious Warfare Mission Area(s). Rescue boat crews from civilian fire and law enforcement rescue units will also benefit from this training.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhalen, T., De Vore, M., COMNAVSURFPAC/LANT Instruction 3340.3F Wet Well Operations Manual, 12 Oct 2021.

Payloads may include offensive or defensive systems and humanitarian support.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for portable boats & small craft assembly kits for an Expeditionary Combatant Craft or relevant vessel. Demonstrate the feasibility of the operational concept via physics-based modeling and simulation. Define the components of the system and hull, mechanical and electrical interfaces as well as additional functional design concepts of the system. Provide a preliminary concept design and an associated component validation plan. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype portable boat & small craft assembly kit capable of being constructed by forward deployed sailors. Evaluate the prototype to determine its capability in meeting the performance goals defined in the Phase II SOW. Demonstrate system performance through prototype evaluation and testing, modeling, and analysis. Evaluate results and accordingly refine the system concept. Ensure that the prototyped hardware clearly shows a path to development of a sea worthy hardened system. The prototype model is to be made available for Government demonstration or testing upon Government request. Prepare a Phase III development plan to transition the technology for Navy use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Support the Navy in transitioning the system for Navy use. Support the Navy in transitioning a fully hardened system for sea trials to be demonstrated on a relevant vessel. Ensure that the system passes an underway test to be developed for the defined test platform. Support for participation in fleet demonstration is aimed at transition with the intent to purchase and integrate the system into the US Navy. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications include disaster recovery efforts where an abundance of quickly assembled small craft will make significant impact in humanitarian relief efforts in moving people and provisions in ravaged environments brought on by natural disasters or war.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLacey, Jim, THE \u201cDUMBEST CONCEPT EVER\u201d JUST MIGHT WIN WARS, War on the Rocks 29 July 2019, https://warontherocks.com/2019/07/the-dumbest-concept-ever-just-might-win-wars/\r\n\tSmith, Eric M, Lieutenant General, US Marine Corps, Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration, &#39;Tentative Manual for Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations\", February 2021, https://mca-marines.org/wp-content/uploads/TM-EABO-First-Edition-1.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Portable Boats; Assembly Kits; Force Protection Operations; Distributed Maritime Operations; Littoral Operations; Contested Environment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479759","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Additive Manufacturing of Textured Piezoelectric Ceramics","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-040","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials; Sustainment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a low-cost, flexible manufacturing technique to produce textured piezoelectric ceramics for undersea sensor applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Ceramics with a high degree texturing or grain alignment can exhibit enhanced properties compared to traditionally manufactured ceramics with randomly oriented gains. One such property benefitting from gain alignment is improved piezoelectric performance of ceramics used for sonar sensor applications (early prototypes have shown upwards of 12dB improvement in performance, enabling sensors to detect potential threats much farther out). Current manufacturing techniques to produce highly textured ceramics involve using an expensive and complex tape casting technique to properly align the material seed crystals. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) could provide a solution by improving the Manufacturing Readiness Level of these new textured ceramic materials and enabling technology insertion at a scalable, cost-effective rate. Current stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP) 3D printers create parts by using a light source to polymerize a liquid photopolymer resin to create a high resolution 3D printed part with minimal need for additional post processing. SLA employs a laser to trace the shape of each layer. DLP, on the other hand, projects a mask of a whole cross-sectional layer at a time. Proposals will be evaluated on the modification to the existing photo-polymerized resin systems used in SLA/DLP 3D printers to be compatible with Navy piezoelectric ceramics. Additionally, there is a need to modify existing 3D printing hardware to incorporate the ability to properly align high aspect ratio seed particles within each print layer to produce grain alignment during sintering of the ceramic. Currently, there are very few commercial solutions that have the ability to align particles or fibers within each layer while printing.\r\n\r\nThe first objective will be to validate the feasibility to integrate a Navy provided piezoelectric ceramic with a photopolymer resin system. The system must demonstrate the ability to properly polymerize with darker colored ceramic materials. Evaluation criteria will include the ability to polymerize each layer, the layer height that is able to be polymerized, adhesion between layers, percent solids loading of the resin as well as density of final parts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe secondary objective will be to demonstrate the ability of the 3D printing hardware to properly align high aspect ratio barium titanate platelets during the printing process. These platelets should be dispersed in the piezoelectric ceramic resin and aligned within each print layer. Prototype samples of approximately 1in outer diameter cylinders will need to be produced and undergo binder burn off and sintering. Prototype parts that will be electrically and acoustically tested will be sent to a 3rd party that will apply electrodes and pole the piezoelectric ceramic parts. Prototype parts will be evaluated by Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division for density, surface finish, particle/grain alignment, texture fraction as well as electrical and acoustic properties. Textured prototype parts will be electrically tested for resonance frequency, capacitance, dielectric constants, and loss factor and then compared to traditionally manufactured non-textured materials. The company will aim to create a material that exceeds a capacitance of 200pf while minimizing the loss tangent. The company will then revisit particle alignment and binder composition as needed in an attempt to improve acoustic and electrical performance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept that will demonstrate the ability to validate the compatibility of 3D printing resin systems with Navy piezoelectric ceramics and for 3D printing hardware that can align high aspect ratio ceramic platelets within the constraints listed in the description. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver prototype hardware based on Phase I work and demonstrate the ability to construct a prototype ceramic that meets the constraints listed in the Description. The prototype hardware will be delivered at the end of Phase II ready to be tested by the government.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Focus on transferring the technology and knowledge to the Navy. Scale/volume/speed of production will also be optimized in this phase. Finalize the equipment and consumables needed to produce the parts and make the products available for Crane/Navy to utilize/purchase. This new technology will support the Navy programs/platforms by providing advanced piezoelectric transducers with better performance and capability. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis added technology/capability will also assist in other projects that require advanced, textured ceramics including hypersonic radomes as well as various sensors in the commercial sector and the military. This specific technology could be used in commercial and recreation sonar such as fish finders and navigation devices. It could be used to develop high resolution seafloor mapping devices. There are some possibilities of using this technology for communications/data transfer. This technology is also commonly used in the medical field for imaging devices.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMessing, Gary L. , et al. \"Texture-Engineered Ceramics\u2014Property Enhancements through Crystallographic Tailoring.\" Journal of Materials Research 32, no. 17 (2017): 3219-3241. https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2017.207\r\n\tRueschhoff, Lisa; Costakis, William; Michie, Matthew; Youngblood, Jeffrey and Trice, Rodney. \"Additive Manufacturing of Dense Ceramic Parts Via Direct Ink Writing of Aqueous Alumina Suspensions.\" International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology 13, no. 5 (2016): 821-830. https://doi.org/10.1111/ijac.12557\r\n\tWalton, Rebecca L.; Kupp, Elizabeth R. and Messing, Gary L. \"Additive Manufacturing of Textured Ceramics: A Review.\" Journal of Materials Research 36 (2021): 3591-3606. https://doi.org/10.1557/s43578-021-00283-6\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Additive manufacturing; digital light processing; DLP 3D printing; textured ceramics; piezoelectric; undersea sensors; sonar transducer\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479761","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"High Power Optical Splitter for Laser Weapon Systems","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-041","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Directed Energy (DE)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

As the output power of these systems has been steadily evolving, the realities of shipboard implementation are coming to the forefront. This includes issues of cost, size, weight, and power consumption on the one hand, and issues of employment and tactical effectiveness on the other. HEL weapon systems can be divided into two main sub-systems: the sub-system that generates the laser power and forms a high quality output laser beam, and the laser beam director that places and holds the beam on target. Between these two units is an optical path that is essentially lossless.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe laser generation hardware is housed below deck in an environmentally controlled space. The beam director is mounted above deck, preferably as high on the ship\u2019s structure as practical. The complete functional independence of the two units and the lossless path between the two make this possible. It also makes it possible, in theory, to supply multiple beam directors from the same laser power source. Theoretically, this would then provide a cost-effective means for providing full coverage around the perimeter of a vessel without the need for multiple laser power sources. Currently there is no commercial capability that can split a high power laser beam.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy needs a technology for splitting a high power laser beam into two separate channels (optical paths). The splitter is intended to be placed in the optical path between the laser source and beam director(s). An optical splitter that can switch the entire beam between two channels is the minimum requirement. However, a technology that can split the bream fractionally between channels is most attractive. The ratio of power split between the paths can be continuous or fixed to discrete increments but, in addition to complete switching between channels, ratios of 50/50 to 20/80 are desired. True splitting of the continuous wave power provides the greatest flexibility in operation, however, solutions that achieve average power splitting by time division of the full continuous wave beam power are acceptable provided the switching between channels occurs at a rate of at least 500 Hz. As the quality of the transmitted beam is of great importance, acceptable solutions should not degrade the beam quality of the input beam (as measured by M2) by more than 5%.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe solution must be capable of handling a minimum of 300 kW of continuous wave input power at a wavelength of 1.0 micron. As a goal, the beam splitter should have a 98% transmission efficiency (95% is the minimum acceptable). As the technology is intended for eventual deployment aboard Navy vessels, the solution should be fundamentally rugged and require no manned intervention (e.g., periodic calibration, alignment, tuning, etc.) during operation. Note that the Navy does not intend to furnish tactical or otherwise representative laser hardware for this effort. The proposed solution should therefore include the means for test and demonstration on surrogate hardware, provided as part of the solution. To verify power handling, demonstrations using scaled hardware, analysis, and comparison to proven component technologies are acceptable. A prototype (hardware and software) of the technology will be delivered to NSWC Dahlgren Division at the conclusion of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

CRAW development is ongoing, but leverages several existing technologies to reduce technical risks. As such, the propulsion system remains a cost and maintenance driver, but has shown to provide the performance that CRAW needs to meet its requirements. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA new 100HP electric powerplant that fits into the CRAW afterbody space to replace the existing propulsion system would be beneficial for various reasons, including reducing cost and maintenance complexity. Ideally, a small business industry partner would be capable of utilizing existing electric motor technology or developing new electric motors to fit the CRAW form factor. The CRAW program envisions a future state where electric propulsion could become the preferred method as electric motor performance meets existing propulsion performance requirements. One of the most difficult aspects of developing technologies for CRAW remains the tight 6.75\u201d diameter form factor. The CRAW program anticipates that use of an electric motor could cut maintenance labor by 50%, which could reduce cost significantly. Ultimately, success of the new electric motor design will be measured by its ability to meet or exceed total energy of 2.5 kW/hrs and 100 hp at 7000 rpm. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe powerplant will consist of three components; 1) a primary or secondary battery capable of sourcing over 100 electric HP, 2) an electric motor capable of continuous 100HP for up to 10 minutes and 3) a small form factor motor controller able to control battery input to the electric motor at To Be Determined (TBD) current levels (type of motor selected and chemistry of the battery will determine current capability). The entire power plant system will be contained in a circular tube of the following dimensions; approximately 6\u201d outside diameter (OD) by 38\u201d in length overall. Details on shell components will become available as the proposed design matures.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nVoltage requirements for a system of this compact nature should lean toward levels greater than 600Vdc to reduce conductor size for a lightweight and condensed packaging scheme.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, overall system weight is restricted to below 90 pounds counting the aluminum shells the devices are contained in; these are approximately 23 pounds. Details for the overall packaging scheme will be available.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEvaluation criteria for the electric powerplant system consists of battery load testing to determine overall available power, duration of the battery and any relevant US Navy testing for abuse and safety. The electric motor and controller performance will be verified via dynamometer testing to confirm the ability to make the expected 100HP.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for a design of a 100HP electric powerplant that meets the requirements in the Description. Provide all analyses supporting the design\u2019s compliance with Navy safety requirements. Establish feasibility through modeling/simulation to meet propulsion performance requirements. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and deliver a prototype 100HP electric powerplant system for testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I. The prototype electric powerplant will be evaluated on its ability to meet propulsion system requirements and its ability to meet or exceed existing propulsion system performance. Likewise, the ability of the 100HP electric powerplant to integrate with the existing CRAW architecture and its set of interfaces will be paramount to the success of the prototype.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to transition to low rate initial production while coordinating with existing CRAW partners. Particularly, Penn State University\u2019s Applied Research Lab (PSU/ARL) will require integration support to integrate the 100HP electric powerplant into the electric CRAW variant for full system testing. It is anticipated that this size powerplant could be useful for other 6.75\u201d devices launched out of external countermeasure launchers (e.g., acoustic countermeasures), as well as high powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and electric automobile applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOsborn, Kris. \u201cThe Navy has High Aspirations for its Multidimensional, Very Lightweight Torpedo.\u201d Warrior Maven \u2013 Center for Military Modernization, 13 January 2022. https://warriormaven.com/sea/very-lightweight-torpedo\r\n\tBennion, Kevin. \u201cElectric Motor Thermal Management Research Annual Progress Report.\u201d National Renewable Energy Laboratory, May 2022. https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/67121.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Very Lightweight Torpedo; Compact Rapid Attack Weapon; Electric Motor; Virginia Class Submarine; External Countermeasure Launchers; High Power Density Battery\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479765","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Extended Reality (XR) for Use in Naval Shipyard Industrial Environments","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-043","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human-Machine Interfaces\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop extended reality (XR) solutions to combat safety mishaps and, decrease repair/maintenance times, additional travel expenses, re-work, congested areas, and unnecessary breakdowns and repairs in naval shipyards.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Navy is seeking the use of XR, which encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), to cultivate a digital workforce for driving digital transformation of Navy Shipyards (NSYs). The Navy is seeking technology to introduce high velocity learning, first time quality, and better objective quality evidence (OQE) while removing safety hazards, travel expenses, unplanned work, and physical costs associated with waste generation, mock-ups, tear downs, assembly/disassembly. The Navy currently works and trains in harsh high-risk environments, lacks operational efficiencies, requires additional travel for troubleshooting, assistance, and inspections, lacks first time quality (human errors), congested areas with tours and workers, and requires unnecessary disassembly and repairs. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn its current state, shipyards carry out activities by qualified and trained personnel who perform procedures established by technical documentation in its physical form. When working in an industrial environment in which losing a single asset can mean million-dollar losses or those with complex procedures or time-sensitive product timelines, increasing efficiency and eliminating human error whenever possible becomes crucial for the enterprise. Failure of valuable equipment correlates to extra cost required to purchase material and/or extra man-days required to recover and repair. When equipment in one shop or area is down, it has potential to create a ripple effect that halts or diminishes work in other areas, leading to even further costs and delays. These issues are currently resolved by following complex procedures for diagnostics and maintenance, some of which are sparsely or poorly documented or so extensive that it requires additional training or understanding when conveying to maintainers. In some instances, troubleshooting or repair requires an expert to travel and perform the maintenance or repair leading to additional travel costs. Moreover, record keeping in physical formats is becoming obsolete so there exists a need to transfer physical documents such as standard operating procedures (SOPs), records, and reports into a secure digital format.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nXR will cultivate the needed workforce by filling in technology gaps and will unlock new opportunities, drive new efficiencies, and inform analytical-based decision making. Public shipyards are currently working to move design, planning, and execution to computers in order to replace the physical formats that are currently used. XR will catalyze the workforce to efficiently move in the direction they are seeking allowing for 2D and 3D interactive digital forms that are easier to understand, work to, and maintain.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy is seeking to develop XR solutions tailored for use in NSY environments to include considerations such as bandwidth availability (e.g., 5G networks), safety effects (e.g., motion sickness), XR interface (e.g., without peripherals such as mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen), 3D model generation, easy content creation, and IT/cyber security zero trust principles and policies for use in arenas such as mockups, training, surveys, hands free step-by-step instructions, reality capture (3D modeling), remote assistance, virtual tours, spacial computing, object recognition, dimensional digital twinning, behavioral digital twinning, remote collaboration, digital retention, and record keeping. XR solutions should allow for long term archival and would not require someone to be physically present for training or assisted applications and should introduce high velocity learning, first time quality, and better objective quality evidence (OQE) while removing safety hazards, travel expenses, unplanned work, and physical costs associated with waste, mock-ups, tear downs, assembly/disassembly. This includes cutting-edge and powerful technologies that provide an engaging environment, leading to useful data capture about the task(s) being performed. Advances in XR in the commercial sector could be adapted for shipyard use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAugmented Reality (AR): \r\n\r\nProblem: Unfamiliar situations or anomalies require expert/experienced personnel or engineering intervention over the phone with word or photo descriptions of the situation during maintenance, inspection, troubleshooting, or any procedural work. The technician or mechanic describes the situation and solution is implemented for remediation. This all happens without the expert seeing the \u201ctrue\u201d environment the person is trying to explain or support and can delay processes. Step-by-step instructions for complex maintenance or assembly involve steps that can be difficult to remember and are subject to interpretation. Maintainers and operators perform steps by reading from an operating procedure while holding the current step in memory before coming back to the paper copy for further instructions, which can be distracting.\r\n\r\nDesired Resolution: The objective is to develop an AR solution to allow for remote assistance and communication in real-time using digital tools. These devices would be the eyes and ears of the expert and the on-site professional can act as the surrogate body to accomplish the work. AR methods would avoid transit and travel costs and time, disseminate knowledge quicker, and less experienced personnel can be accompanied by senior personnel or experts when needed. With AR, users would work on steps, without diverting their eyes or hands from the work being performed. As tasks are completed, there would be visual confirmation and the next step would be presented when the current step is completed safely and with good quality. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nVirtual Reality (VR): \r\n\r\nProblem: Training is primarily performed in classroom-based sessions, with physical mock-ups, part task trainings, just-in-time trainings, and work familiarization with examinations and evaluations. Mechanics and technicians need a human trainer and rely on rudimentary tools and paper documentation to complete their job functions. Shipyards incur costs associated with providing the right information, by the right people, at the right place, and with the right equipment. Current mock-ups are being physically produced, torn down, and lose historical knowledge overtime, which cost up to millions of dollars depending on the intricacy of the project. Construction requires experts from various organizations and locations to meet for collaboration and usually entails tours of areas where work will be performed, which congest and distract the area. Space at NSYs is at a premium and VR would save space on mock ups, tear downs, and/or storage of mock ups not being utilized, rather than bringing in large bulky machinery and components for training or mock-up or utilizing large spaces for this application, virtual reality allows access to features through a 3D virtual model that can be visualized in its intended space while a 1:1 scale is maintained.\r\n\r\nDesired Resolution: The objective is to develop a VR solution to modernize operations and amplify physical mockup training by creating immersive training environments, streamlining the creation and sustainment of technical documents, and enhancing mechanic, technician, and engineering services. VR methods would reduce costs by decreasing the amount of text to be translated; streamlining training processes for operators of complex equipment; training in safe environments that would otherwise be harmful, expensive or dangerous; and providing the opportunity to train on exact configurations rather than \u201csimilar\u201d configurations. VR would allow access to features through a 3D virtual model that can be visualized in its intended shop or space while a 1:1 scale is maintained, removing the need to view in a reduced format. Additional text, graphics, and videos should be superimposed along with any manuals, procedures, or documentation. VR solution should allow all parties to collaborate in their current location(s) removing the need for travel expenses. Furthermore, mock-ups and spaces would be viewed digitally and can bring in unlimited number of machinery or equipment of any size, enabling realistic demonstrations similar to physical spaces. This removes the need to physically interrupt locations or to build expensive parts for demonstrations. Mock-ups will have the capability of digitally being placed in the intended location to capture any potential issues that may arise during installation or use before physical movement takes place.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMixed Reality (MR): \r\n\r\nProblem: Quality assurance and inspection tasks are subject to human error with a potential for negative outcomes such as equipment failure, injury, pollution, damage, and more. Inspectors perform inspections using checklists in order to confirm quality of work, equipment, or structures. \r\n\r\nDesired Resolution: The objective is to develop MR to provide enhanced information to the inspector. The user can be taken through the inspection process where settings, states, locations, and parts can be presented to the inspector who can compare expected values and verify with automated visual confirmation and has the ability to alert the user when results are outside expected values. MR methods would reduce inspection errors due to human error, improve reliability of inspection tasks, assist with interactive checks, and automate storage or results for traceability and reproducibility. MR should also provide the value of monitoring student behaviors to ensure proper job execution and increased procedure accuracy. Instructors can adjust training based on student\u2019s ergonomics, positioning, and time spent in certain areas to help reduce safety risks and exposure while applying the best ergonomic practices.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept to implement XR solutions into secured industrial workspaces by identifying the highest anticipated risks associated with the concept and proposing viable risk mitigation strategies to technological and reliability challenges. Feasibility must be demonstrated through modeling and analysis for a useful product to be used in NSYs including technical feasibility of integrating virtual or augmented visuals into current processes as well as meeting risk management framework guidelines associated with cybersecurity compliance. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop, task, test XR, and deliver a prototype for existing networks utilizing current work processes. Develop hardened system architecture and complete the risk management process for gaining cybersecurity accreditation for system deployment. Develop high fidelity prototype(s) that are acceptable for use within the current NSY infrastructure and demonstrate technological competence through evaluation and modeling over systems and processes that are already available and in place at NSYs. Demonstrate prototype performance in a simulated or realistic/piloted environment. Identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks, roadblocks, and challenges. Create milestones to incorporate this technology into the Phase III development plan.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Further refine the prototype(s) and support the Navy in transitioning, testing, validating, and certifying the technology for shipyard use.

The CRAW is contained within a Launcher Assembly (LA). The Launch Tube (LT) is a major component of the LA and is capped on one end with a muzzle cap/nose assembly and sealed to sea pressure on the breech end by the Mk 77 Gas Generator (impulse system). The CRAW and ancillary hardware such as a pressure plate, ram plate, drag fin assembly reside within the LT between the muzzle face of the Mk 77 Gas Generator and the muzzle cap/nose assembly. The LT is designed to meet Grade A shock requirements (i.e., heavyweight, high-impact, air-backed, wetted-surface environment), implosion, hydrostatic, hydrodynamic and Mk 77 impulse/launch loads. The current stainless steel LT represents nearly 50% of the total projected weight of the overall CRAW LA weight. Furthermore, there is little to no ability to achieve weight savings in any of the other LA hardware, including the CRAW itself. Additional service life/environmental factors include, but are not limited to, Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO), Grade A shock qualification (i.e., heavyweight, high-impact, air-backed, wetted-surface environment), shipboard vibration, corrosion preventions/life, and contributions to CRAW and Mk 77 Gas Generator Insensitive Munitions qualification.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks a new composite LT that would replace the existing stainless steel in the CRAW LA, which would be beneficial for various reasons, including reducing cost, weight, and manufacturing complexity. Ideally, a small business industry partner would be capable of utilizing existing commercial composite material technology or developing new composite materials that can be shaped to house a 6.75-inch CRAW device form factor along with the Mk 77 Gas Generator and CRAW launcher ancillary hardware. The CRAW program envisions a future state where composite launch tubes could become the preferred manufacturing method as material properties could meet existing launch tube requirements. One of the most difficult aspects of developing launch tube technologies for CRAW remains the tight 6.75-inch diameter form factor, combined with the stringent requirements to meet the aforementioned operational and environmental loads, and the machinability of the launch tube internally and externally along its entire length. Ultimately, success of the composite launch tube will be measured by its ability to meet existing CRAW launch tube requirements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRequirements and performance characteristics for a composite CRAW LT are (but are not limited to):\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintains existing shipboard interfaces per CRAW LT drawing (to be provided) \u2013 same form factor as existing LT tube design\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintains existing interface (internal to LT) with Mk 77 Mod 0/1 gas generator (drawing to be provided)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Meets or exceeds existing LT service life (2 years deployed with minor maintenance (paint and anode replacements, 4 years to full maintenance cycle)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reusable: Threshold \u2013 unlaunched condition; Objective \u2013 launched condition\r\n\r\n\u2022 Meets requirement for Grade A shock qualification under MIL-DTL-901E\r\n\r\n\u2022 Maintains Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) safe designation of current system\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adheres to MIL-STD-464 \u2013 latest rev\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adheres to MIL-STD-461 \u2013 latest rev\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adheres to MIL-STD-167 \u2013 latest rev\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adheres to NAVSEA Temporary Alteration (TEMPALT) Manual - NAVSEA S9070-AA-MME-010/SSN/SSBN, 3rd Revision, ACN-5\r\n\r\n\u2022 No impact on corrosion susceptibility and life of surrounding hardware/structure\r\n\r\n\u2022 No hazardous material generation or addition to post-launch combustion by-products effluent from exposure to launch process and/or seawater\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adheres to NAVSEA Implosion requirements for VIRGINIA and COLUMBIA Class\r\n\r\n\u2022 Compatible with existing Weight Handling Equipment (WHE), Ordnance Handling Equipment (OHE), and Weapon Handling Equipment (WHE)\r\n\r\n\u2022 Minimum weight reduction, compared to the current LT: Threshold \u2013 150 lbm; Objective \u2013 175 lbm\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

This will allow contractor personnel to perform on advanced phases of this project as set forth by DCSA and NAVSEA in order to gain access to classified information pertaining to the national defense of the United States and its allies; this will be an inherent requirement. The selected company will be required to safeguard classified material during the advanced phases of this contract IAW the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), which can be found at Title 32, Part 2004.20 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Support the feasibility of meeting propulsion performance requirements through modeling/simulation. The Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design, develop, and deliver a prototype composite LT for testing and evaluation based on the results of Phase I. The prototype composite LT will be evaluated on its ability to meet LT requirements, and its ability to meet or exceed existing LT system performance as identified in the Description section. Likewise, the ability of the composite LT to integrate as part of the existing CRAW Launcher Assembly along with its set of interfaces will be paramount to the success of the prototype. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the work under this effort will be classified under Phase II (see Description section for details).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to transition to low rate initial production which will occur while coordinating with existing CRAW partners. Particularly, Penn State University\u2019s Applied Research Lab (PSU/ARL) and Navy Warfare Centers will require integration support to integrate the composite LT into the CRAW Launcher Assembly for full system testing. Testing at this point would include MIL-STD-2105 (Insensitive Munitions), Implosion, Hydrostatic, Explosive Shock qualification, and other shipboard integration and ordnance qualification tests, as required. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this composite launch tube could be useful for other 6.25-inch and 6.75-inch devices launched out of external countermeasure launchers (e.g., acoustic countermeasures).

Maritime platforms specifically need this information continuously to support safety of ship, weapons deployment, and network communications. They rely on inertial navigation systems to provide continuous position and velocity information for accurate navigation. However, current inertial navigation systems are large and expensive to build and maintain. Small-scale factor IMUs, such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEMS)-based sensors, micro-Hemispherical Resonating Gyro (HRG)-based sensors, and other micro-Machined Vibrating Gyroscope (MVG)-based IMUs, offer the advantage of lower production costs through batch processing and fabrication. Some MEMS and HRG devices have also proven superior survivability to environmental shock and vibrations, which makes them ideal for military applications, given their potential for low cost and small size. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the commercial sector, long-term accuracy has been a challenge for MEMS gyros with gyro-bias stability and Angular Random Walk (ARW) performance metrics not yet meeting navigation-grade standards, though bias-stability in MEMS accelerometers has been demonstrated to near-strategic-grade standards. Achieving the long-term accuracy desired for Naval maritime applications (going from hours to days), requires further reductions in gyro bias drift. Some factors shown to impede gyro performance include temperature drift error, mechanical imperfections, imbalances, and misalignments in the fabrication process. These can be resolved by effective vacuum packaging for environmental-resistant MEMS and/or effective temperature compensation by control circuitry, quadrature compensation, laser trimming, and circuit compensation. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLow-cost production has been a challenge in commercial HRG technology because early designs of macro-HRGs have focused on the higher performance, and higher cost, space application market. As a result, there are a limited number of HRG manufacturers, which has driven up production costs. However, new fabrication techniques, such as glassblowing and glass molding, have been developed to fabricate 3D-MEMS, or micro-HRG, devices that show the same promise of lower fabrication costs with batch production. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese existing and emerging technologies are applicable in meeting the future needs of the Navy to develop a lower cost, lightweight, and highly accurate 6-axis IMU that can be integrated into future U.S. Navy platforms. While both technology areas present challenges, fabrication and manufacturing techniques have developed significantly in MEMS wafer-scale etch processing and micro-machine fabrication techniques used to produce micro-HRGs and other MVG-based sensors in recent years. \r\n\r\nTo meet mission requirements of future deployed surface and subsurface vessels, the Navy needs a low Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) 6-axis (3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope) IMU with performance equivalent to or better than the existing Ring Laser Gyro (RLG) navigator in use in the Fleet today. Government subject matter experts will guide development for these specifications. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAchieving the desired accuracy in position, velocity, and attitude will require gyro bias stability to be demonstrated at or better than 0.005 degrees/hour (1 sigma) and ARW < 0.0005 degree/root-hour (1 sigma). Accelerometer bias stability must be demonstrated at or better than 5ug. Contributions of other error sources (that is, scale factor, misalignment, etc.) should be balanced to meet the overall error budget of the IMU. SWaP-C must meet IMU performance requirements in the range shown below:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Size: < 5 Liter\r\n\r\n\u2022 Weight: < 10 Kg\r\n\r\n\u2022 Power: < 25 W\r\n\r\n\u2022 Cost: < $100,000\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

With the deployment of AM expanding to the shipboard environment, the manufacturing capability of more complex items are becoming more readily available to the Fleet. With this addition in capability, there is an increased risk of potential inadequate parts being installed in ship systems. There is a need to be able to reduce the risk of installing field-expedient parts designed by the Fleet. Part of this risk reduction can be achieved through proof testing of the designed parts at the point-of-need. This capability would allow shipboard leadership to make a more informed, rapid risk assessment of part viability based on empirical test data from the desired solution. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are increased needs for AM afloat as it is explicitly identified in the COMNAVSEA Campaign Plan 3.0 as a technology focus area. The Navy directly supports efforts to integrate AM into the Fleet and support a more self-sufficient ship. The Navy seeks to maximize its use of AM to fabricate \"hard to source\" or obsolete parts, reduce cost, field more effective systems, and reduce reliance on vulnerable supply chains through production at the point of need.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project will be to develop a modular proof testing apparatus for locally manufactured components in the shipboard environment. The solution must include the ability to test non-uniform objects, tools, and parts which should be able to be mounted and tested within the same test unit. In addition, different loading conditions and scenarios must be able to be applied to the test part within this apparatus. Example loading scenarios include, but are not limited to: tensile, compression, torque and pressure. The operational conditions within these expeditionary settings include ship motion, ship vibration, shock, ventilation, and electromagnetic interference (EMI). In order to successfully install the test rig and enable adequate operation of the equipment, the machine must not experience severely degraded performance under these conditions. All processing must be completed on the system and must operate in a non-networked environment. Sensor packages supporting tracking of system operation and performance, as well as machinery health monitoring, should be included in the design. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent test apparatuses of this nature are specialized laboratory equipment that is not designed for use in the dynamic shipboard environment. In addition, current commercial tensile, compression, torsion, and pressure testing systems require a degree of training for interpretation of data that is not feasible for the typical Navy operator. There exist no commercial solutions that can provide easy-to-assess part test responses that allow for rapid risk reduction. Furthermore, simplistic design and usability will be beneficial since most Fleet personnel will not have an engineering or science background. This should include ease of use from a test setup and operation standpoint, but also clear, definitive, and easy to understand results display and interpretation. The designed solution should have on board processing capability, with full traceability and logs available. These systems must include a modular test fixture and load application design to be able to accommodate the variability in types of parts being 3D printed. In addition, since both metal and polymer solutions are being deployed, the solution should be able to accommodate forces necessary for both material types, including, but not limited to, carbon fiber reinforced nylon and 316L stainless steel. The solution should be able to test parts that fit within a 20\u201d Wide x 12\u201d Deep x 12\u201d High volume. The system itself should be hatchable, and take special consideration to minimize footprint of the design. The aforementioned design considerations to overcome the technological gap is paramount as a risk reduction method to enable the Fleet to safely install AM solutions shipboard. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe product will be assessed against the MIL-STDs listed below:\r\n\r\n1.

MIL-STD-740-2, Structure-borne Vibration Acceleration Measurements and Acceptance Criteria of Shipboard Equipment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a conceptual design of a modular proof testing apparatus that can test shipboard manufactured parts, including Additively Manufactured items as described in the Description section. Demonstrate the feasibility of the conceptual design through detailed modelling, simulation, and analysis for the proposed solution. For example, 3D models, simulations, and/or design documentation to illustrate the work holding/fixturing modularity option to accommodate the various types of applications and loading scenarios. The conceptual design feasibility analyses should also indicate how the apparatus will be hardened for the shipboard environment to be able to accurately apply loads, but also handle the dynamic shipboard environment. Include, in the conceptual design applicable sensors and details on how the machine will be optimized for Fleet use, to include, but not be limited to, operation, maintenance, and results display. The design details should include the on-board processing setup and the proposed results reporting display. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Build and deliver a prototype system that can apply proof testing loads to sample parts that can be operated in the shipboard environment by shipboard personnel. Demonstrate how shipboard environmental mitigation will be applied to account for incoming vibration and shock, and uncontrolled temperature and humidity. Subsequent testing of these mitigation protocols will be needed to evaluate shipboard viability and should be included. Examples of the simplified setup and results should be included in the prototype, with processing occurring local to the proposed solution. The prototype is expected to be installed either shipboard or at a Navy facility for continuation testing and evaluation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Assist the Navy to transition a production ready proof testing machinery optimized for Navy expeditionary environments with modular options for tensile, compression, torque, and mechanical pressure loading applications. The equipment must be able to operate in the shipboard environment (machine shop or welding spaces) and be able to accurately apply loading conditions for various, non-uniform applications of multiple material types including, but not limited to, chopped carbon fiber filled Nylon and 316L Stainless Steel. The solution must be able to simply interpret results to inform a risk-based decision-making analysis for Fleet personnel. All processing must be completed on board the system and must operate in a non-networked environment. \r\n\r\nThe applicability of such a design could be implemented in environments beyond just the shipboard community, to include the local maintenance activities and Shipyards. In addition, commercial applications of the solution for the shipping or oil and gas industry and other Military forward operating bases may be available.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAmend, JR, Jr., & Lipson, H. \"FreeLoader: An Open Source Universal Testing Machine for High-Throughput Experimentation.\" Proceedings of the ASME 2011 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering\r\n\tUnited States, Congress, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.

The Navy operates in harsh environments where rain, hail, salt, fog, and other natural conditions would harm sensitive electrons like an Actively Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna. So, to protect those AESA antennas, the Navy uses a radome as cover to protect from environmental conditions. Because the radome covers the antenna, it must also allow it to function with minimal impacts when transmitting and receiving radio frequency signals over the frequency band of operation. Since an AESA antenna can scan over a large angle, the radome needs to minimize the distortion of the transmitting and receiving radio frequency signals over the angler range of operation. This is all typical and can be accomplished with ridge low loss dielectric materials. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMore complex radomes now have Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSS) worked into the design. As the name implies, these surfaces help to filter out undesirable frequencies by allowing only selected frequencies pass through. Thus, the radome can act as a filter and aid in the reduction of electromagnetic interference. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith the advances in surfaces, the Navy is seeking to improve current radome capabilities to help beam shaping and sidelobe reduction on the edges beyond the field of view. Currently there is no commercial solution. A new capability could be designed into a radome in a passive manner by structuring the FSS or could be an active design where some sort of bias is applied that activates an adaptive surface. Also, a reactive surface could be designed to limit the amount of power that is passed through the radome, thus avoiding saturation of the electronics. This design would be non-reciprocal, in that the transmit power would be allowed to pass through the surface but the receive power would be limited. In terms of a traditional circuit approach this could be thought of as a switch or circulator with a limiter.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe material also must be capable of meeting environmental requirements, quasi planner (can allow for minor curvature,) and meet government objectives for bandwidth, one way roll-off greater than 20 dB, and low losses operating approximately 4 GHz to 6 GHz.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

The issue of energy limitation becomes more critical for continuously submerged persistent systems due to difficulties of deploying and retrieving systems for maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe Navy seeks a solution to extend system endurance without mission interruption or manned support. Available underwater persistent system capabilities would be significantly enhanced by innovative approaches to energy extraction in the underwater environment. In particular, underwater in-situ energy harvesting and storage could realize increased system endurance and reduced cost. The Navy is seeking an innovative way of powering underwater persistent systems by energy extraction from the seabed or underwater environment with power level sufficient for continuous reliable operations. The use of energy harvesting eliminates potential operational impacts associated with large, unique, specialized energy storage.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe desired technology centers on harvesting energy from the undersea environment for a long duration, maintenance free power source to fit in a compact form factor without a presence on the ocean\u2019s surface. Long duration mission profile should maximize the continuous available energy as measured in watt hours. This energy requirement could therefore rely on novel methods for continuous energy harvesting to power onboard systems. All other approaches will be considered. The challenge of miniaturizing and incorporating these technologies into the volume constraint and successfully deploying this system in the field remains the dominant technical issue associated with this technology. Currently, no commercial system exists that meets the requirements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe proposed power source must have a minimum storage shelf life under controlled conditions of six years without maintenance prior to deployment. The system should be autonomous and require no maintenance in while deployed.

During this process, uncured rubber stock is placed within a heated mold before the mold is closed. The rubber cures and conforms to the mold cavity before the mold is opened and the finished part is removed. Within the Navy, numerous undersea sensor components, such as cable plugs and connectors, are fabricated using rubber compression molding. The molding process typically uses tooling made from steel due to the high temperatures and pressures required. However, steel tooling can have high costs and lead times. Advances in AM (also known as 3D printing) and new high-temperature polymers may allow these steel molds to be replaced with AM polymer molds, which could significantly reduce costs and lead times and open up new workload capabilities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLimited research has been done to adapt AM technology and polymer materials to rubber compression molding. Some commercial AM systems have the capability to print room-temperature silicone molds or low-volume injection mold inserts, but the materials used in these systems do not translate well to the high continuous use temperature of the compression molding environment. The Navy is seeking the development of an additive manufacturing process that can rapidly create high strength, high temperature, and low-cost polymer tooling for use in rubber compression molding applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPolymer AM was chosen as the preferred process due to its speed, low cost, easy implementation within existing spaces, geometry flexibility, and safety. Metal AM processes will not be considered due to relatively high investment and post-processing costs. Several challenges exist for bringing polymer tools close to parity with traditional steel tools. Surface roughness, dimensional accuracy and precision, durability, and longevity are key focus areas to consider. Surface treatments, coatings, machining, and other post processing techniques may be used, but should be minimized to reduce overall costs. Polymer materials may be thermoplastics, thermosets, composite reinforced, photopolymer, or other novel material and must be non-hazardous. Companies may develop a new material, machine, or process; or adapt a commercial material, machine, or process to meet the Navy\u2019s needs.

System should meet or exceed conventional NWP metrics for skill and computational expense, especially for high impact weather events and high error scenarios.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Rapid progress has been made in the past few years in the development and application of AI/ML meteorological models, especially with respect to mirroring capabilities of state of the art dynamical NWP models. There is recent evidence that AI/ML models can be as skillful as state-of-the-art NWP using standard metrics (e.g., anomaly correlations, root-mean-square errors, etc. \u2013 see Weyn et al. 2020, 2021; Lam et al. 2022; Bi et al. 2022, 2023; Zhang et al. 2023). However, it remains unclear how well these models perform using more complete metrics that incorporate high-impact weather events (e.g., rainfall, peak winds, etc.), smaller scale atmospheric features, and high sigma (i.e., uncommon) weather pattern scenarios. Furthermore, many of these AI/ML models are trained with relatively coarse resolution reanalysis data. A challenge remains how to better use volume of data (including from commercial sources) for better initial conditions and forecasts. While certain aspects of traditional NWP infrastructure may be difficult to change (such as data assimilation and model analysis states), other aspects such as parameterized physics, construction and diversity of ensembles toward probabilistic forecasts, and identification of forecast uncertainty are ripe for improvement by AI/ML methods. This topic aims to bolster strong development of AI/ML NWP techniques by soliciting targeted research and development to robustly improve skill and resolution of weather forecasts. Specifically, we seek to improve scientific understanding and forecast capability at the medium range (5-14 days) and subseasonal (14-90 days) timescales for both state variables and derived metrics (e.g., clouds, precipitation, etc.). While it is anticipated that weather feature fidelity will be achieved via large ensemble development, use of downscaling towards high resolution techniques would also be considered. Robust methods to resolve high impact cases and development of verification statistics that do not smooth/average out those signals will be necessary. Finally, a significant component of this effort involves development of understandable (explainable) AI/ML infrastructure and techniques that support refined physics improvements and the ability to substitute newer methods as routines evolve.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Perform a comprehensive feasibility study on the proposed end-to-end software architecture as well as demonstrations of AI/ML technique effectiveness to address this problem. Study should include a comprehensive literature review including the state of the science and trajectory, an analysis of alternatives on different AI/ML methods and their strengths and weaknesses, and a discussion on the most challenging research and development parts of the problem (focusing on physics representation, skill challenges with lead-time, and representativeness of weather features at different resolutions). Analysis must include potential for large ensemble and probabilistic approaches and/or high resolution and downscaling techniques and the potential need to use coupled earth system models (that include atmosphere, ocean, land and/or ice) to foster longer range skill. Requirements on computational architecture/software/data should be outlined, as well as proposed metrics to improve beyond point-based averaged metrics towards emphasizing high impact weather events, skill dropouts, and bifurcating scenarios.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: A prototype system capable of running real-time forecasts comparable with state of the art dynamical weather prediction systems shall be delivered at the end of Phase II. Development of this capability includes building out the appropriate data ingest, physics representation, forecast propagation, and data output. Architecture components must conform to leveraging processes available to traditional dynamical modeling platforms. Throughout this development, computational efficiency benchmarks should be provided to assess acquisition hardware needs. For more mature efforts, there should be a strong focus on developing very large ensembles and/or high resolution and/or other proposed novel/innovative use of NWP, data assimilation and initial condition sensitivity to demonstrate fidelity for high impact events on 5-90 day time scales. Software must incorporate potential to train/retrain model or model elements. Verification and validation (V&V) will be emphasized throughout the Phase II, with multiple retrospective and real-time V&V development check points. System should be flexible enough to have iterations of skill improvement, validated using impact-based probabilistic metrics with concurrent ONR field campaigns (that may include one or more of analysis of tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, boundary layer, and air-sea interaction). There will be particular interest in comparison of skill with other NWP models and analysis of high error/dropout events when AI/ML technique is superior to the traditional NWP model (and vice versa). Sensitivity to grid resolution, initial conditions, and training versus validation datasets (seasons, years, models) will need to be tested and reported.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Primary Naval transition opportunity would be to the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center as an operational weather forecast model run in real-time production. Phase III efforts toward this goal would entail building out the software infrastructure needed to run on local compute, dedicated HPC, and/or government cloud compute solutions. Careful consideration would be needed to develop an environment conducive to upgrades, such as from new data sources, retrained AI/ML equations, and application to varied use cases (such as regional domains, output variables, verification statistics, etc.). Phase III, or alternate projects, would also coordinate with partner Air Force and Army numerical weather prediction programs for other DoD use cases and spin-off efforts. There will also be opportunity and potential to partner with other government agencies outside of the DoD, such as NOAA, NASA, and DoE for their weather modeling use cases. Commercialization beyond government services would support a growing industry with varied needs for computationally efficient and highly specialized meteorological forecasts, including demonstration of commercial weather data services, tailored platforms spanning multiple industries (e.g., agriculture, insurance, aviation, etc.), and general public interests.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWeyn, J.A., Durran, D.R. and Caruana, R., 2020.

There is a research interest in exploring the application of Generative Text artificial intelligence (AI) (such as Chat GPT, GPT3/4, etc.) to facilitate the filling in of text-based data collection forms; however, other tools and approaches will be considered if it is explained how they would contribute to the requested capability. The data generated by this general purpose form completion engine will lead to reduced data curation for subsequent analytics. The desired solution will: \r\n\r\n(1) generate a general-purpose curation/creation text engine that facilitates completing a variety of text-based forms. \r\n\r\n(2) describe a mechanism for incorporating technical terminology & phrasing appropriate for a specific usage domains (potentially including sensitive or classified terminology and phrases) along with a general baseline generative text engine.\r\n\r\n(3) be designed to be useful with minimal compute, and without immediate or sustained connection to cloud-based processing resources. Cloud-based Processing intense resources may be used in developing the general-purpose engine and achieving threshold performance, but the proposal must describe how the initial capability will be refined to be useful with minimal computer and storage footprint. Further, the proposal must state the size and capabilities for processing that shall be required to achieve with threshold and objective (final) performance in the desired system.\r\n\r\n(4) describe any key technologies being used in creating the capability, and clearly characterize the data usage rights associated with those capabilities. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe concept being proposed in this SBIR topic shall demonstrate the use generative text algorithms to curate the text entries as they are being created. The desired solutions should: \r\n\r\n(1) focus on a workflow / process for a prompting dialog between the generative text engine and the user vice developing large language models. It is expected that some tuning of large language models may be required to address a specific technical domain, but that should be as constrained as possible to focus on the process whereby users interact with the models to facilitate form completion.\r\n\r\n(2) be easily adapted for incorporating technical jargon and domain specific phrases for different usage domains. The technique(s) for incorporating specialized technical language into the application must be described. \r\n\r\n(3) address anticipated prompt tuning techniques to adapt to specific technical domains enabling techniques for one-shot or few-shot learning.\r\n\r\n(4) generate appropriate phrases/descriptions (an understanding of what is being described) in different task domains that are correctly structured and generate consistent and appropriate technical descriptions.\r\n\r\n(5) be scalable for use from PCs/Tablets/Phones with limited connectivity to a local server and be cloud- connected, not cloud-dependent. \r\n\r\n(6) provide for the use of instructions + answers as a sustainable workflow for maintaining / utilizing the authoring / curation engine.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This effort is aimed at enabling the creation of text-based forms with consistent terminology and phrasing by applying generative text artificial intelligence (AI) technology during the authoring of form content. The desired technology will assist content creators by offering interactive curation during the content authoring. The application of the developed technology will result in more consistent form content that is amenable to automated analytics on the generated text and will therefore accelerate and improve accuracy of ship maintenance reporting. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNew advances in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in application pipelines have demonstrated the potential to support a wide range of technical reporting domains; however, there are significant challenges in generating text with relevant content and terminology when completing maintenance reports. While LLMs show impressive performance in general knowledge and reasoning capabilities, they have inherent limitations and lack capabilities required for broad language understanding and use in the real world (e.g., specialized or proprietary knowledge of terms, facts and concepts). Fine tuning, parameterizing, and combining LLMs with external tools should produce capabilities that enable LLMs to be more useful in real world settings, such as that of facilitating completing form-based descriptions of technical problems and their impacts. The desired applications will provide customized content to support maintenance reporting workflows and answer technical questions across a variety of maintenance reporting use cases.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct research in open source LLMs with commercially permissive license (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT) to identify, select, and track appropriate models that have the potential to perform well for the Navy domain and desired downstream tasks. Selected models must be usable in both research and commercial settings. The solution will need to work on resource constrained devices (e.g., tablets, laptops), which may be disconnected from the Internet and cloud-based resources during form authoring. To improve the performance of models in deployment environments, different techniques (e.g., distillation, supervised fine-tuning, parameterization) should be identified, explored, and evaluated to ensure correct information is generated for the defined downstream tasks. Define the task and data sources that will be used to act as a suitable proxy for ship maintenance reporting, which involves consistently generating text necessary to fill-in ship maintenance forms. The longer-term technical objective is a general-purpose form-completion engine that can be readily adapted to various technical domains and terminologies and utilize alternative technical jargon and phraseology. The selected LLM and a systems-based approach will minimize model behaviors that generate incorrect content for the selected domains and defined tasks. It is assumed that the task being performed will require new knowledge that was not part of the pre-training data of a general large language model. Successful approaches will securely combine new private data into the workflow and customize the LLM for a target domain and authoring task. Phase I should result in proof of concept demonstrations of key capabilities so as to show how a prototype tool will be built and demonstrated during Phase II. The primary metrics for Phase I success will be quality of proposed workflows for user interaction and a demonstrated use case to show how forms would be completed using a representative large language model.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Build on the tools and results of Phase I to create a viable prototype tool for form completion. Utilize real world forms completion tasks. Ideally the problems and real-world data sources would relate to Navy ship maintenance reporting and ship material readiness, although use cases for other transition customers would be acceptable. A prototype tool will be built and tested to demonstrate a proof of concept involving a user interacting with the system to produce a complete and accurate report. The Ship&#39;s Maintenance Action Form (OPNAV 4790 or two-kilo) is an example of a primary maintenance data system (MDS) form that would be of interest, which is used to report both deferred and completed maintenance actions. The mission-degrading casualty report (CASREP), is another example that is used to report an equipment degradation to the operational commander which impacts mission readiness. Automated tools will (1) generate text and fill in these semi-structured forms with free-form text fields, (2) reduce data curation requirements, and (3) enable analytics on the curated data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor Naval applications, the contractor will need to be able to process Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and/or classified data sources up to the Secret level. The government team will provide contractor access to historical reports to support development and evaluation of the proposed techniques, automated tools, and analytics (e.g., text generators, classifiers). The historical text was often written inconsistently and therefore making it challenging to automate analytics across this data. Address inconsistencies and unique language in the various text reporting workflows and describe how the proposed capabilities will support generation of high-quality data for reporting. Describe and demonstrate analytics/metrics on the text data generated to assess the quality of the text being generated. Assess how the tool will run on resource constrained hardware (e.g., tablets, laptops) with reasonable compute capabilities and document its ability to run on-line and off-line (i.e., that the developed technology would be suitable for shipboard/at sea use with limited access to cloud/remote computing capabilities). The tool will provide a tailorable vocabulary database suitable for use across different technical reporting domains (e.g., electrical systems, distillation systems, turbine mechanics, etc.). The workflow and user interface will be fully described and demonstrated as appropriate. The workflow shall be demonstrably easy to use and will demonstrate valid, predictive results. Technical evaluations, capability demonstrations, and metrics will focus on the quality of the human machine interaction (HMI), completeness / correctness of reports, and generalizability of approach across technical reporting domains shall be addressed at the completion of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integrate and transition the developed tools for support of the NAVSEA SEA21 Ship Maintenance Data Improvement Initiative (SMDII) Program of Record (POR) to support automated text processing requirements for Navy ship maintenance reporting and ship material readiness. The tools being developed are expected to be applicable to a broad range of form completion applications, including for medical, maintenance, and other domains reliant on text-based data entry.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDoD Instruction: Casualty Reporting (CASREP) Policy (Material) (2014). https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jan/05/2003140406/-1/-1/0/CI_3501_3G.PDF\r\n\tCOMUSFLTFORCOMINST 4790.3B, Joint Fleet Maintenance Manual (JFMM). https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/SUBMEPP/JFMM/Searchable_JFMM_Rev_D-1.pdf \r\n\tCNRMC Fleet Desk Guide (FDG). https://dodcac.portal.navy.mil/navsea/CNRMC/fdg/default.aspx \r\n\tYongliang, Shen; Kaitao, Song; Xu, Tan; Dongsheng, Li; Weiming, Lu and Yueting, Zhuang.

Criticality of the traffic depends on the types of missions that are currently being executed, mission phase, etc. and is, consequently, highly dynamic. Reference (1) outlines command and control (C2) constructs for the U.S. Navy and Army. These constructs have different warfare commanders, functional commanders, and coordinators \u2013 with different network applications / priorities \u2013 that must be synchronized to achieve operational objectives. The Navy seeks technical solutions for (1) identifying different types of traffic, (2) associating each traffic type with specific platforms as well as functions/missions, (3) enabling the Commander to prioritize these functions/missions, and (4) translating the Commander\u2019s prioritization into network policies that can be implemented across the network to ensure, to the extent possible, end-to-end delivery of mission-critical traffic.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are two main technical challenges that must be solved:\r\n\r\n(1). Reliable mapping of Commander\u2019s intent and mission objectives into structured data forms that can be combined with policy representations and reasoned with by machines. Supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) training requires more exemplars than may be available given the highly dynamic nature of Commander\u2019s intent or mission objectives. Machine representations need to precisely capture the original human meaning within the intent as well. Reference 2 provides an overview of the application of artificial intelligence in different areas of the private sector. \r\n\r\n(2). How to combine machine representations of policies? Ontologies can be used to capture schema but live tactical feeds for situation awareness, which may be ad hoc, are also critical.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a framework/approach to address the challenges outlined above. Prepare a report documenting the proposed framework/approach along with any preliminary results or data that help demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach. Include in the report a proposed set of benchmarks for assessing performance of the framework and a clear articulation on how the framework is viable with incomplete training data sets. The latter is important because warfare commanders are individuals who have different preferences for receiving and displaying information to support a decision.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Implement the proposed framework using representative data sets for different functions or missions. Demonstrate how the framework correctly interprets intent and then translates that intent into traffic engineering policies. Show how this intent is met both with dynamic network demand and changing circumstances (e.g., priorities change due to a triggering event). Prepare a report documenting the framework implemented, how it was tested, the resulting performance, and recommendations or lessons learned for future implementations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integration and transition into ADNS is the objective of Phase III. The commercial sector has historically relied on fixed, terrestrial networks and can either easily procure more bandwidth to alleviate congestion or add redundancy. For truly mission critical traffic, the commercial sector builds dedicated networks with dedicated resources to guarantee performance. However, the push towards 5G deployment and increasing need for real-time control systems for autonomous vehicles, automated manufacturing, smart city concepts, etc. are pushing the commercial sector to develop prioritization mechanisms and how to orchestrate their employment across the network to ensure end-to-end delivery of mission-critical traffic. A potential commercial transition option that can be explored is to integrate the algorithms developed into the zero-touch network management solutions developed for 4G/5G mobile services by ZTouch.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tZiegenfuss, MAJ Mark Paul.

Ultrasonic inspection of corrosion on cables requires direct contact with the surface along with the application of a water-based gel, neither of which are easily adapted into a UAV for cable inspection [Refs 1, 2]. Infrared (IR) thermography cannot view more than a few centimeters below the surface and may require high temperatures to provide useful data [Ref 3].

The development of a more available option for UAV corrosion assessment would enable remote inspections for a variety of commercial infrastructure applications. Current commercial infrastructure (wind turbine blades, ship hulls, etc.) makes use of a variety of sensor outfitted unmanned systems (UxS); however, none are currently optimized for stand-off, large scale corrosion inspection to the best of our knowledge.

The proximity and overlapping frequency allocations of multiple wireless systems inevitably lead to communication interference. Military environments, both on land and at sea, face additional challenges with constantly shifting transmitters that change location, transmission direction, and frequency. The move toward every platform doing many operations simultaneously drives up the number of functionalities each platform engages in and each has its own transmitter. The resulting electromagnetic environment is complex and carries a significant risk of unintentional interference, especially given the likelihood of signal reflections from neighboring platforms within the battle group. Design and placement of antennas alone cannot sufficiently address the issue. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile digital signal processing techniques have made great advances in enhancing modern electronic warfare, communications, and radar systems, the most efficient approach to interference mitigation is to protect the receiver from exposure to interferers. This requires hardware that can suppress interference as close to the receive antenna as possible, typically at the front end. And as future receivers aim to eliminate analog down-conversion stages and ingest wider bandwidths for direct digitization, the demand for front-end filtering becomes even more critical. Meanwhile the pace of battle has accelerated and the sheer bulk of signals needing attention drives the priority of shrinking the time it takes to respond to any one scenario. Speed of adaptation becomes a critical system parameter. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is provision of a number of fast tuning, analog filters. Individually they need to possess steep band edges, highly attenuating stop bands, and low insertion loss. All proposals should quantify their expectations regarding these parameters. Static filters are a well-established and reliable technology. They would be sufficient if the interferers\u2019 frequency, spectral width, and power were known and consistent, which unfortunately is no longer the case. Effectively addressing the challenges posed by today\u2019s electromagnetic environments demands the use of multiple fast tuning or self-generated notch filters. These filters should be generated independently (in linear fashion) and adjusted in terms of center frequency. A mechanism should be defined to control the bandwidth and depth, which may be interdependent parameters. If active control is required, the same control parameters must produce the same response independent of the previous control settings (i.e., no history effects). The time between the arrival of a new interfering signal and the beginning of its suppression within the total signal needs to be less than a microsecond and ideally less than 1 nanosecond. Additionally, the passband of the total filter should exhibit transmission losses of << 1dB when on and less when parked/inactive/off. The technology selected for demonstrations should imply the net total device insertion loss upon signal Input/Output (I/O) should not dominate the system behavior. Furthermore, the filters need to demonstrate characteristics such as reliability, environmental temperature stability, and resistance to mechanical vibration. To succeed as a product, a high level of as fabricated device-to-device repeatability is needed, or testing and calibration costs can balloon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBoth innovation of the proposed notch filtering mechanism and a lack of distortion of acceptable amplitude signals are sought. Device concepts requiring a reference signal for the signal to be removed must describe how to obtain same for uncooperative transmitters. Systems requiring signals analysis to determine the frequencies at which filters should be tuned need to include that processing time in their turn on/off time estimates. The production of out of signal band interference is not an acceptable byproduct. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe solutions proposed will also be judged on the processing latency they introduce and their design complexity and Size, Weight and Power (SwaP) when the functional instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) contains hundreds of simultaneous signals of interest and there is only one antenna available. The ultimate IBW will exceed 20 GHz. Photonic approaches are acceptable but not required. Such proposals should indicate the expected required optical power of the photonic carrier. All proposals should be careful to define the acceptable range of Radio Frequency (RF) carrier frequencies, estimate wall plug power costs of implementation, describe all during operation circuit trimming required, and provide a discussion of the individual contributions to the system&#39;s overall noise figure in a technical risks section. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

Current power generation system technology for USVs supports missions on the order of days to weeks, but many future missions will be measured in months. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne of the most critical enabling capabilities for USVs is reliability of the Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&E) systems. A significant part of HM&E systems is power generation, which is presently leveraged from manned platforms. These power generation systems, primarily diesels, are not specifically designed for high reliability and maintainability without human intervention.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nModular generators are functionally equivalent to single engine based shipboard diesel or gas turbine generators. The modular configuration enables a common flexible design approach to meet USV cross platform needs, both large and small, to be scalable to total power needs; enables graceful degradation of the system rather than a complete system shutdown in the event of a component failure; and can also be configured as needed to adapt to available platform space.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nInnovation is sought to configure and optimize smaller kW scale power units to achieve the following:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Modular Generator Total Power Output: 1 MW or greater\r\n\r\n\u2022 Fuel: NATO F76\r\n\r\n\u2022 Building Block Power Unit Scale and Type: 10\u2019s-100\u2019s kW High Density Diesels, Stirling Generators, Fuel Cells, Gas Turbine Generators.

The tool will allow examination of search area, coverage rate, probability of detection vs probability of false alarm, cost per unit area covered, etc. The tool will account for the inherent mobility of unmanned maritime vehicles to optimize area coverage, based on vehicle capabilities and sensor payload selections. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe toolkit will be applicable to all potential phases of ASW operations, including barrier search, wide area open ocean search, classification, localization, and engagement. Environmental variability will be taken into account to provide sensor coverage estimates for various theater ASW scenarios. Based on environmental variables and constraints and expected target detection and classification parameters, the tool will assess sensors of differing modalities and optimize sensor selection and asset allocation. The tool will account for both acoustic and non-acoustic means to detect, classify, and localize targets. Inputs from oceanographic field forecasts will be used to optimize ASW laydowns of assets, manned and unmanned. The tool will enable direct comparison of performance to manned counterparts but will also analyze performance of unmanned systems working in conjunction with manned platforms to enhance theater ASW. The tool will allow an operator to simultaneously examine the performance of multiple platforms (manned and unmanned) and explore different deployment options (i.e., different force laydown/formations) against a number of threat options. The system will determine optimal placement of these assets and associated sensors, and be used to inform development of critical technologies. For scenarios involving multiple unmanned surface and undersea vehicles, the toolkit will consider track synchronization requirements across multiple platforms, defining communication paths required to achieve contact correlation and coherent target track formation. Track synchronization shall be timely, robust, and accurate enough to support automated contact correlation. The toolkit will be able to take into account cases where one or more unmanned platforms or sensors fail or are unable to communicate during mission execution, resulting in the need to reallocate and redistribute assets to provide the best area coverage for the scenario. Shifts from a benign communications environment to a degraded communications environment will be considered and taken into account. Toolkit assessments and theater-level allocation recommendations will be able to be dispersed across Commands via assured server to server communication.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe toolkit will provide information via a map-based graphical display that is intuitive and easily understood by a trained operator. The toolset will provide waterspace management capability for manned and unmanned platforms, allocating undersea assets by depth in addition to latitude and longitude position. The toolkit will provide graphical means to display analysis products for areas of interest (two dimensions) or for volumetric water spaces (three dimensions). The toolset will have the ability to easily update ASW target characteristics in order to predict ASW performance of selected platforms and sensors. Although not the focus of this SBIR topic, the basic technology will be extensible to Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) targets and scenarios.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

The threshold Radio Frequency (RF) range of interest is 1-to-20-GHz. The antenna system must be capable of High Power use = 100 MW peak power, and waveguide fed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Components for HPM weapons often work well in the laboratory, but fail in the tactical environment (e.g., dirt, shock and vibration, extreme temperature, exposure to salt water). The objective of HPM weapons is generally achieved by maximizing the Radio Frequency (RF) power density (PD) (PD in units of W/m^2) at the target. PD on target depends on power handling capabilities and gain of the antenna system. A limitation on HPM weapons is achieving appropriate even gain across a large enough bandwidth while maintaining high peak power handling capabilities. The current systems, which couple to HPM antennas, utilize a waveguide output and a wide variety of high-power mode converters already exist, thus any waveguide input can be considered but fundamental modes are encouraged. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile high power antennas exist, most have not been designed with harsh military environments or lightweight steerable mounts in mind. Considerations such as materials that support lighter weights while maintaining mechanical strength to combat wind and water loads (i.e., watertight, wave slap, salt fog, etc.), foldability for storage when not in use, and precise steering to quickly engage multiple targets. \r\n\r\nProducing high RF power density at the HPM source (in order to produce high PD at the target) will require a multi-disciplinary investigation. Electrical engineering and physics will be required to achieve the objective for high electric field (E) in the antenna input as well as the mechanical requirements needed to survive the harsh military environments. The high power and pulse repetition rate present potential for electrical breakdown in the antenna systems. The pulse duration and maximum size of the aperture can lead to reduced aperture efficiency due to pulse traversal time across the aperture. Current designs feature vacuum-insulated overmoded waveguide feeding a reflector-type antenna. Of course, innovative designs must not introduce unwanted effects; for instance, a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) sufficient to damage the source. An innovative design must be able to handle the stress environment of tactical employment, including reducing side lobes to minimize potential Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) to nearby assets and systems, manufacture, transport, storage, launch and operation. The evaluation of the stress environment should include, but is not limited to, shock, vibration, fatigue, water tight, wind loads, corrosion, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEY ANTENNA PARAMETERS \r\n\r\nWill be negotiated with each proposal depending on submitted design.

The batteries have interfaces up to 1000VDC, and containment must account for protection from shock, vibration, internal/external fire, overpressure, managing battery gas release, kinetic effects, etc. The containment system should provide a modular construct to enable a level of isolation between battery modules of different form factors, inside of the container so that propagation potential is minimized.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Energy storage systems, comprised of high power and energy-density batteries, offer the potential for numerous benefits as applied to power systems of different types. However, high density storage systems, which may present electrical, chemical, and flammability/explosive hazards, must be able to be simply and effectively installed in locations which can be populated by personnel and sensitive equipment. Because of this, robust and rugged enclosures must be designed that are capable of overcoming effects related to temperature, pressure and internal/external effects, at the same time.\r\n\r\nBattery systems will need to be enclosed in containment structures that protect from internal (e.g., other failing modules) and external (e.g., fires, weapons effects, moisture) threats. Containment should not be tied to a specific cell size or chemistry, nor to a specific battery module design or form factor, as it is likely that battery technology approaches and designs will change in time. Thus, containment approaches that are universally useful (e.g., standard containment rack widths or designs that can intrinsically be adapted to various battery designs) are recommended. However, the approaches must provide substantial innovation because the effects upon size and weight due the enclosure and containment cannot substantially adversely affect the power and energy density of the storage systems. Innovative R & D to support the creation of compact, lightweight, and high performance enclosure structures should support the evaluation of means of enclosing and isolating energy storage systems from the surrounding environment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe overall structural approaches should be amenable to large shipboard-embedded systems. Approaches must be considerate of the conditions of release, including MW thermal flux from failed components, overpressures, and flame effects. The system should include a directed ventilation approach to allow gasses generated to escape into a specific, acceptable location or direction. The enclosure shall not require substantial volume above that already taken by the storage system itself, thus an enclosure system will not expand the volume by more than 10% of the racked storage components. Ultimately the design should ensure strength of the shelving and resilience to shock, vibration and environmental effects as defined in the MIL specifications provided in the References. Any design should be able to support devices enclosed with voltages up to 1000VDC (including arcs and plasmas) and power capabilities up to 1MW, and provide penetrations to allow cabling sufficient for moving energy in and out of the enclosure. Cooling may also be assumed to be available, but no colder than 40 degrees Celsius at a flow rate proportional to the volume of the box. It should not be assumed that copious quantities of cooling liquid are available to cool the enclosure itself, but rather the items placed inside. However, small amounts could be utilized by the enclosure itself to support internal environmental characteristics. Aspects of packaging of components internal to the enclosure could be manipulated to support the overall requirements of the enclosure system; however, the design must be flexible and adaptable to specific components or combinations of components inside.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Perform advanced modeling and analysis to define the energetic characteristics of cascading battery failure conditions, where it is assumed that a device fails on the order of one per minute continuously. The basis of the analysis will utilize the thermal and inertial effects from released gas and ejecta from cells. The evaluations will be utilized to determine the requirements for scalable architectures which create minimal impact on device density. Utilizing this information, a conceptual design will be provided with traceable simulation basis to demonstrate performance. If possible, validation of simulated performance parameters will be provided prior to the Option phase. This work will be used to help define a containment volume of sufficient dimensions to be considered a standard rack, with dimensions of ca. 25\u201dW x 48\u201dD x 72\u201dH.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Scale any conceptual enclosure design artifacts and material selections produced under Phase I and its Option period, if exercised, to relevant size, which provides dense rack-mount capability and serviceability aspects. All input and output interface points will be defined and performance simulations evaluated with a greater level of detail. An interface Control Document (ICD) will be created to define clearly all connection points, types, dimensions, model numbers, etc. The complete containment equipment will be built to the designs produced, and validation of the performance aspects (inertial, mechanical, thermal, chemical resilience) will be demonstrated via failure of Li-ion batteries.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Design and build full-scale flexible rack-mount enclosures for a particular military application, with the internal modular structure built to a specific battery. The containment will be designed to the intent of meeting appropriate MIL-SPEC operational requirements, and a combination of detailed analytical evaluations and specific test events will be performed. \r\n\r\nA scalable, cost-effective enclosure scheme that provides local isolation from energetic release will enable lighter, more compact energy storage to be implemented onto a greater number of platforms and operational equipment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDual use applications are anticipated for commercial marine large scale battery applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\u201cMaritime Risk Focus: Lithium-ion batteries fire risks and loss prevention measures in shipping\u201d, 3/21/2023, https://maritimecyprus.com/2023/03/21/maritime-risk-focus-lithium-ion-batteries-fire-risks-and-loss-prevention-measures-in-shipping/\r\n\tNAVSEA S9310-AQ-SAF-010, Technical Manual for Batteries, Navy Lithium Safety Program Responsibilities and Procedures, http://everyspec.com/USN/NAVSEA/NAVSEA_S9310-AQ-SAF-010_4137/ \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Battery, Thermal Runaway, Containment, Enclosure, Fire\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479807","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Advanced Wearable Integration and Synchronization Hub (AWISH","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-064","topic_description":"","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479809","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Advanced Nondestructive Inspection System for Detection and Characterization of Corrosion under Thick Coatings","branch":"Navy","topic_number":"N241-065","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials; Sustainment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

The system will be used to inspect the entire immersed portion of a ship hull autonomously (either tethered or autonomously) and map the location and extent of corrosion without damaging the coating.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Some situations exist where the condition of the substrate needs to be assessed in situ under thick polymeric coatings. This assessment includes the degree of adhesion of the coating to the substrate and the condition of the substrate from a corrosion perspective. There are several potential non-destructive technologies that may be able to \u201csee\u201d through thick coatings. The SBIR topic includes assessment of select non-destructive technologies to monitor interfacial coating/substrate phenomena and substrate corrosion as a function of coating thickness. The accuracy and reliability should also be addressed.

Selection will be based on the potential of the NDE processes to penetrate coatings thicknesses to evaluation coating adhesion, substrate conditions, and coating defects over various conditions of surface roughness. The proposed methods should be validated via modeling and simulation or experimentally by fabricating and testing of simple coupons. For validation purposes, coatings of various thicknesses will be applied to steel plates using a specified standard. The coupons should have at least one surface defect region with a diameter no larger than half the coating thickness, but smaller size defects would be preferable. The NDE methods should be assessed as to the quality and accuracy of the objective measurements. There should be minimal loss of signal responses as a function of coating thickness. The speed at which the requisite information can be obtained (ft2/minute) will also be an evaluation parameter. Offerors must show at least one NDE technology that can reliably characterize the quality of the adhesive interface layer as a function of coating thickness, assess the spatial resolution of the technique, and assess the substrate surface conditions such as corrosion including at site with significant surface roughness.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDuring the Phase I Option period, if exercised, identify key areas of the proposed solution that need further improvement or development, and depending on the availability of funds, validate the modifications. Evaluate possible methods to autonomously inspect the entire submersed portion of the platform. Plan for Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The NDE technology(ies) selected in Phase I should be further tested using larger coated coupons of the size necessary to better gauge what the speed (ft2/minute) of detection of decohesive sites, coating defects, and substrate corrosion, if present. Work with a Navy laboratory for collaborations in assisting the offeror in maturing and transitioning the NDE technologies. Further modeling validation will be required and further testing to assert the reliability and sensitivity of the NDE technology will be needed. Other acceptance testing as dictated by the Navy Laboratory should also be done.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork in Phase II may become classified. Please see note in the Description.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The ability of some NDE methods to penetrate most non-metallic materials allows non-contact examination of materials that are opaque in the visible range such as concrete, insulating foam, and alloy surfaces. The properties of interest across the industries may be broadly categorized into three areas\u2014layer thickness, defects and contamination, and material characterization. Although the key parameters of interest are application-specific, the advantage of some NDE methods over other mature technologies is in providing new information. There may be commercial applications for the technology developed during Phase II, depending on the type of information obtained by employing this NDE technology. The possible use will depend on the degree of attenuation through an alternative medium. Potential uses could be the condition of rebar (degree of corrosion, if any through concrete pillars for a bridge).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDwivedi, Sandeep Kumar; Vishwakarma, Manish and Soni, Akhilesh. \u201cAdvances and Researches on Non-Destructive Testing: A Review.\u201d Materials Today: Proceedings, Volume 5, Issue 2, Part 1, 2018, pp. 3690-3698\r\n\tHenneke, E.G. et al. \u201cThermography ?

These \u201creplacement\u201d magazines offer an opportunity to forgo \u201cnear infinite life\u201d requirements and examine the potential benefits of limited life (tens to hundreds of shots) and potentially expendable, quickly replaceable munition type power and cooling sub-assemblies.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: For the Navy and Marine Corps, the demand on \u201cinfinite duty cycle\u201d cooling by water chillers deteriorates causing limited operational employment. Relieving the design and alignment constraints of separating the systems and examining \u201crechargeable magazines\u201d for cooling and electrical power in the deployment of such kW-class HEL systems may have benefits on small platforms (ground or airborne, including unmanned weapon platforms) and offers some unique research opportunities. The Navy seeks development of a solid state laser that is compact, battery powered, uncooled and on the order of tens of kilowatts (kW) operating at one micron wavelength, and able to produce continuous wave high energy laser (HEL) energy as an integrated subsystem. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently, prototype HEL systems are being deployed in a variety of platforms as laser weapons; prototype systems have been deployed by the Navy platforms as laser weapons to destroy targets and threats. These are each separately developed subsystems (power, cooling, laser) \u2013 but the interest is a combined small size, weight, and integrated power with cooling (SWaP-C) for tens of kilowatt class HEL systems limit utility from those combined systems. Use of systems that are \u201cdirect diode\u201d or \u201cpixel/vixel\u201d based are of primary interest, possibly using coherent, spectral, or incoherent power beam combination techniques due to their inherent high efficiency, whereas fiber or other gain amplification systems are seen as less efficient and require higher levels of optical integration risk. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor the Navy and Marine Corps, the demand on \u201cinfinite duty cycle\u201d cooling by water chillers deteriorates causing limited operational employment. Relieving the design and alignment constraints of separating the systems and examining \u201crechargeable magazines\u201d for cooling and electrical power in the deployment of such kW-class HEL systems may have benefits on small platforms (ground or airborne, including unmanned weapon platforms) and offers some unique research opportunities. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUsing the same concept as a reloadable magazine \u201cclip\u201d, this SBIR topic seeks innovation in \u201creplaceable\u201d rechargeable, man serviceable, cooling and battery magazines. These \u201creplacement\u201d magazines offer an opportunity to forgo \u201cnear infinite life\u201d requirements and examine the potential benefits of limited life (tens to hundreds of shots) and potentially expendable, quickly replaceable munition type power and cooling sub-assemblies. The Navy seeks a compact battery powered, uncooled, tens of kilowatt (10\u2019s of kW), one micron wavelength, HEL integrated solid state laser (SSL) subsystem. High cooling capacity and thermal requirements have driven HELs to focus on water chilled systems that are heavy and operate within tight tolerances for temperatures. The potential to dissipate the heat generated by the laser amplifier medium and externally pump, or exhaust, the resulting heat from the sources of heat - to areas or materials that dissipate the heat, have only been explored to a limited extent. Similarly, the potential to \u201cdump\u201d heat (for example, by exhaust or release of superheated water vapor) are seldom contemplated. However, in some circumstances, this may be a preferable and acceptable trade for the purposes of reducing subsystem weight. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe DoD has a great demand for compact and robust unmanned weapon platforms. Therefore, DoD has a resulting great demand for more compact and robust uncooled kilowatt - class laser systems for a variety of short time use cases and applications, if temperature tolerant designs for one micron wavelength lasers can be found. Industry will benefit as class laser system for a variety of short duty cycle power and thermal applications, as well from the reduced well SWaP-C requirements for technology in applications where lasers are used to cut, weld, or ablate and clean substrates with limited surface areas. At present, an air cooled, compact battery power kW class HEL system is not a known commercially available item used with laser subsystems.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEY PARAMETERS \u2013 Laser Magazine \r\n\r\nPower Threshold: 10 kW (Objective: 20 kW); ability to focus light at a range of kilometers with minimal atmospheric turbulence (Cn2\r\n\r\nHEL wavelength: one (1) Micron (1020-1095 um)\r\n\r\nTechnology: Solid State Laser (Preference for high efficiency laser semiconductor based diodes or similar pixel LED emitters)\r\n\r\nLaser beam output quality (M2): Threshold: 2, (Objective < 1.4, vertical & horizontal, Gaussian or top hat.) \r\n\r\nLaser Weight: Threshold: 120 lbs (Objective 20 lbs)\r\n\r\nVolume: Threshold: 50 cubic inches (Objective < 20 cubic inches); \r\n\r\nAir cooled compact HEL prototyped system with input air 60\u00b0C and 90% humidity \r\n\r\nAudible Noise: under 60 dB\r\n\r\nOperating Temperature: Threshold: 15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, Objective 10\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

Control of individual shutter elements or in groups is desirable, but not required.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Star trackers are in use on strategic systems, which must survive and operate in harsh radiation environments. Calibration via a closed shutter allows for the direct characterization of radiation induced detector noise apart from the target star. The development of this technology will help enable more capable star trackers to operate with increased reliably in higher radiation environments than currently capable. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExisting Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) shutters have been demonstrated to be reliable in a variety of environments, including space-borne missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) [Ref 3]. The existing technology has been improved with a shift from magnetic to electrostatic operation [Ref 1]. Additional micro-mechanical geared shutters have been developed by industry for applications from TVs to imagers [Ref 2]. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of this SBIR topic is to develop MEMs shutters that can eventually be utilized to provide live calibration functionality to in-flight calibration sensors in hostile environments. Live calibration data provides options for making strategic missions less sensitive to radiation and allowing them to perform in increasingly hostile environments, with increased precision. The lack of advancement will come at a direct cost to the performance of the strategic systems in terms of performance and concepts of operations with regard to stellar sighting.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a design for a fast (< 0.1s) global optical imager micro shutter (minimum size 0.5 x 0.5 cm2) capable of operating in high radiation, strategic environments over 30-year mission timelines. Control of individual shutter elements or in groups is desirable, but not required. Include in the design the plans/methodologies for microfabrication and testing to demonstrate the capabilities desired in Phase II. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I Option, if exercised, will include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the Phase I design and execution plan, fabricate and characterize a small lot (up to Qty: 5 wafers) of global optical image micro-shutters. This characterization may include a dynamic/force assessment [Ref 4] and thermal/radiative sensitivity for sample MEMS devices. The prototypes, test samples, and characterization results should be delivered by the end of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Based on the prototypes developed in Phase II, continuing development leads to productization of the MEMs micro-shutter device. While this technology is aimed at military/strategic applications, micro-shutters are used more broadly in the space-based astronomy industry. The devices incorporating the MEMS micro-shutters may be subject to several common test environments for strategic sensors, including radiation and vibration environments.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tM. -P.

In spite of fabrication challenges, hard ceramics such as silicon carbide are seeing increasing adoption as substrate materials for optical mirrors due to their high thermo-mechanical stability and high stiffness. These products find use in applications such as space-based telescope primary mirrors, for instance. Grinding and polishing are traditional methods of achieving final surface form and are well-suited to a broad range of materials, including hard ceramics. Traditional grinding methods, however, are limited to relatively low-NA optical surfaces. For soft metals, single point diamond turning (SPDT) can produce a wide range of surface forms, including high-NA and aspheric surfaces, while achieving extraordinarily precise surface form tolerances [Ref 1]. SPDT has also recently shown promise as a method for machining certain hard ceramics, although further research may be required to optimize cutting parameters [Ref 2]. Techniques such as ion etching and magnetorheological finishing (MRF) may also be used to produce arbitrarily precise surface forms in a variety of materials [Ref 3], although they are slow and labor-intensive. The Navy has an interest in developing a deterministic and cost-effective fabrication capability for high-NA optical surfaces in hard ceramics (such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride, or similar) with optically precise surface form tolerances. In addition to the machining challenge, high-NA surfaces add challenges to the process of validating the achieved surface form (interferometry and profilometry are common methods) which must also be overcome. The capability will be demonstrated by the production of small (sub-centimeter-scale) convex and concave hemispherical mirror substrate test articles to be delivered at the conclusion of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop methods for producing hemispherical mirror substrates in hard ceramic materials. Perform a feasibility study for achieving the target surface form and radius of curvature thresholds listed below for two types of mirror substrates: a concave hemispherical mirror (substrate A) and a convex hemispherical mirror (substrate B). Assess the scalability of the proposed approach in terms of per unit labor hours and throughput. Material and threshold mirror surface specifications for test articles to be produced in Phase II include: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Material: Hard, non-porous ceramic (such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride, or material of similar hardness) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Radius of curvature (both convex and concave): 3 mm +/- 500 nm \r\n\r\n\u2022 Nominal outer diameter (OD) of mirror surface: 3mm \r\n\r\n\u2022 Spherical surface irregularity may not exceed 500 nm \r\n\r\n\u2022 Surface roughness may not exceed 30 nm RMS \u2022 Mirror substrates shall be uncoated \r\n\r\n\u2022 Localized surface imperfections (scratch and dig): Best effort (Goal is 10-5 per mil spec MIL-PRF-13830) \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMethods that provide a path toward deterministic production of aspheric surfaces are of interest, but not strictly required. Methods of metrology for validating the final surface form must also be proposed and assessed for scalability for arbitrary surface forms and numerical aperture. A detailed risk assessment of the proposed fabrication and metrology methods should be provided.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Implement the methods proposed in Phase I for the production of a set of test articles for delivery to the Navy by the conclusion of Phase II. These deliverables consist of five (5) prototypes of substrate A and five (5) prototypes of substrate B with key specifications listed in Phase I above. Parts will be evaluated based on the form of the primary hemispherical surface; other dimensions and surfaces are not critical. Each prototype must be delivered with metrology data indicating the achieved surface form.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The machining capabilities demonstrated in Phase II advance the state of the art for optical component fabrication in durable materials. Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. The prototypes will be evaluated for compatibility with existing and planned strategic system component designs. The technology will be used in Phase III to develop components according to specific design requirements for strategic sensors. The end product technology is applicable to a range of dual use applications that benefit from the stiffness and thermal stability properties of hard ceramics. These include space-based and airborne optical systems and high power laser applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t1. Higginbottom, D. B.; Campbell, G.

Despite these advantages, two key limitations prohibit their use in certain demanding applications: (a) strong interference either desensitizes or compresses the entire spectrum, and (b) radio frequency (RF) sampling analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) consume large amounts of electrical power, which can be difficult to manage in certain harsh environments where antennas are deployed. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMicrowave photonic signal processors and analog fiber-optic links are well suited to overcome these fundamental limitations.(3,4) In particular, wideband analog photonic phase modulation enables designers to encode analog signals in the optical domain without any small signal approximations, enabling the use of sensitive coherent receiver photonics to sample in-phase and quadrature components and decode phase information in the digital domain directly [Ref 1]. The benefits of analog signal transport over fiber are also well known, enabling coherent sampling multichannel receivers and power-hungry ADCs to be integrated in more amenable locations with access to power, cooling, and maintenance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWork produced in Phase II may become classified.

It must have developed a concept for a workable prototype or design to address at a minimum the basic requirements of the stated objective. The below actions would be required in order to successfully satisfy the requirements of Phase I: \r\n\r\nDemonstrate the feasibility of a design of a photonic-assisted direct digitization receiver with a 3MHz\u20134 GHz target, 3MHz-2GHz threshold instantaneous bandwidth (IBW), an effective noise figure (NF) of < 8 dB target, < 13 dB threshold, and an input-referred full-scale power greater than 26 dBm target and 15dBm threshold from 3MHz-2GHz, and 15 dBm target -10 dBm threshold from 2 GHz\u20134 GHz. The direct digitization receiver should not desensitize or compress with spurious above ADC spurs over the entire input power range. With a noise figure (NF) less than 8 dB and an assumed SNR > 6 dB, the receiver should also be able to receive signals (1 MHz analysis bandwidth) down to < -100 dBm target, < -88 dBm threshold, even in the presence of in-band interference up to the aforementioned levels. The demonstration shall include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFEASIBILITY DOCUMENTATION: Offerors interested in participating in Direct to Phase II must include in their response to this topic Phase I feasibility documentation that substantiates the scientific and technical merit and Phase I feasibility described in Phase I above has been met (i.e., the small business must have performed Phase I-type research and development related to the topic NOT solely based on work performed under prior or ongoing federally funded SBIR/STTR work) and describe the potential commercialization applications.

An attributable cause to the increase in reported PE can be an increased awareness regarding the phenomenon; however, a single root cause has not been identified. PEs, as experienced by flight crews, have consisted of multiple symptoms, including cognitive impairment, numbness, tingling, lightheadedness, behavioral changes, and fatigue. These reports have been connected to several Class A mishaps, leading to a growing awareness across all aircraft activities on the recognition of inflight human symptomology. While reported PEs peaked in FY15\u201316, in recent years there has been a marked decline; however, they still occur, and between FY18 to FY23 there have been reports of 934 PEs, some resulting in significant medical complications. Most of the reported PEs have been in the F/A-18 community including legacy (F/A-18C) and super hornets (-E, -F, and -G); however, PEs are also reported in the T-46, T-6, and F-35 communities. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Air Force (USAF) have been working diligently to determine the cause (or causes) of PEs. While several vulnerabilities have been identified and corrected, reports of PEs still persist (934 between FY18-23) and have shown to be difficult to diagnose with causal factors remaining elusive. Mitigating the risk of PE has proven to be complex and not rooted in one single cause. Additionally, it is critically important to note that this is not a U.S. Navy-exclusive problem. It is a joint issue affecting aviators and aircrew across the Department of Defense (DoD) component services, including the USAF, U.S. Army (USA), and our International partners. The USN stood up two root cause and corrective action (RCCA) teams for both the F/A-18 and the T-45 with the mission to investigate PE for both platforms. Among the 564 recommendations between the two teams, the RCCA recommended that the USN take actions to research aircraft components and physiological monitors for aircrew members; maintain, upgrade, and test aircraft components; as well as train aircrew members on gear fit and potential PE symptoms to reduce PEs. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the DoD has invested a significant amount of funding and resources into the investigation of unexplained PEs within the flight environment. As part of this effort, devices to monitor the physiological state of aircrew have been proposed, prototyped, developed, and tested in a variety of environments, including in-flight. These devices range from forehead patches to measure near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, functional or cerebral), compression garments with integrated heart rate and respiratory sensors, eye trackers within helmets or simulated cockpits, pulse oximetry (SpO2), instrumented orinasal masks, and electroencephalography to measure neural activity during environmental exposures. Aircrew physiological monitoring during flight operations to identify signs and symptoms associated with PE end states could help better identify causal factors, improve treatments and outcomes, and return aircrew to operational duty sooner. Combined with the fact that PEs still occur, the requirement for aircrew PhysMon remains a top capability gap and a top safety issue across the DoD and component services.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe commercial medical instrument industry is well established in the manufacture of devices designed to monitor various physiological endpoints. The military leverages these commercially available devices as starting points to adapt, optimize, and ruggedize for operation in a dynamic aircraft environment and hostile military environments. The common feature between those commercial medical devices and those specially augmented for the military is their means of connecting to IT devices to transmit their data.\r\n\r\nBluetooth is a short-range wireless technology used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances. Medical monitoring devices universally employ this technology standard to transmit physiologic data. Additional benefits include reduced device bulk and no wires. Both are unwelcome snag hazards to worn flight gear and equipment/hardware inside the cabin/cockpit. Snag hazards are not only detrimental to crew resource management (CRM) for normal and combat operations, but can constitute a substantial impediment in the event aircrew are required to ditch from the aircraft. As a result, the PhysMon devices currently evaluated by the USN and USAF for use in operational flight environments also use Bluetooth. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Bluetooth is not secure and is vulnerable to a variety of hacking and tracking methods. While its short range provides some measure of protection, the technology has continued to improve over time, and in the case of active U.S. military operations and Private Health Information (PHI), this is insufficient. Bluesnarfing (information theft), bluejacking (spam, phishing, malware), bluebugging (backdoor access to spy), bluesmacking (denial of service), and car whispering (eavesdropping on communications) make continued use of Bluetooth in deployed, wearable PhysMon devices an unacceptable risk. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy requires a more secure method for transmitting data from wearable PhysMon devices and replace the universally used Bluetooth. While military versions will likely require additional security measures subject to the area of operations (AO) or area of responsibility (AOR), commercial development of a more secure method of transmission for wearable PhysMon devices would be positively received and relevant. Methods can include, but are not limited to, magnetic secure transmission. Important considerations are Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements, wireless capability, no interference with worn gear, and battery endurance. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile PhysMon devices are mature technologies and available commercially in various forms, operation in conjunction with aircrew flight/safety gear or within the unique confines of an aircraft cabin (hypobaric pressure, oxygen-enriched, temperature) was not a primary factor in their design. The USN and DoD have been developing a number of devices in response to PE that are optimized for military environments, but like their commercially available counterparts, these military-specific devices use Bluetooth for data transfer. The increased computerization of today\u2019s military and evolving cyber threats necessitate a more secure way for transmitting physiological data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdvanced, innovative solutions for secure, encrypted transmission of data from wearable PhysMon devices are sought. Design can include, but is not limited to, Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology, commercial encrypted wireless links (CEWL) or miniature encrypted wireless links (MEWL) and/or Ultra Wide Band (UWB) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Intercom System (WICS). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe candidate technology will demonstrate the ability to securely transmit medical endpoint data from an existing wearable PhysMon device. The technology developed will eventually be required to be adapted to a flight environment on military aircraft with special emphasis on naval environments featuring moisture and salt. Highly desirable criteria include minimal size profile, low power requirements, long battery life, minimum weight and bulk, wireless, and no interference with flight/safety gear. In order to have a common reviewing process for all potential applicants, it is requested that all submitting performers, at a minimum, employ heartrate as the physiologic endpoint of the wearable monitoring device. 1. Threshold: The method of recording heartrate should be\u2014at a minimum\u2014similar to fitness trackers, Photoplethysmography (PPG). 2. Objective: Full wave 60Hz electrocardiogram (ECG).\r\n\r\nOther important considerations include: 1. The device should provide secure transmission to both storage and real-time display of monitored physiologic endpoint data. 2. There are many existing commercial and military-optimized wearable PhysMon devices currently available. The ability to convert these existing devices for secure transmission of data is a desirable objective. 3. For existing wearable monitors, designs may not allow easy access into device housing for reasonable modification of machinery. An attachable dongle to these existing devices overriding the stock Bluetooth in favor of the secure method is a desirable objective. 4. This technology should be able to transmit data across a distance of at least 240 m (This is the range of Bluetooth 5.0. Bluetooth 4.0 is 60 m).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote: NAVAIR will provide Phase I performers with the appropriate guidance required for human research protocols so they have the information to use while preparing their Phase II Initial Proposal. Institutional Review Board (IRB) determination as well as processing, submission, and review of all paperwork required for human subject use can be a lengthy process. As such, no human research will be allowed until Phase II and work will not be authorized until approval has been obtained, typically as an option to be exercised during Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: PHASE I: For a Direct to Phase II topic, the Government expects that the small business would have accomplished the following in a Phase I-type effort.

Ensure that the prototype meets the requirements listed below. Begin to validate the use of the prototype with human participants. Through this testing and evaluation process make iterative refinements to the prototype. Required Phase II deliverables will include a working prototype, and a report about the overall project progress. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the goal of this SBIR topic is to develop a more secure method to transmit physiologic monitoring data from wearables rather than developing a new wearable device for monitoring. As such, this SBIR topic is open to applications proposing a new secure wearable monitor or modification of existing wearable monitor incorporating secure transmission methods of physiologic endpoint data. Additional endpoints such as respiration rate, pulse oximetry, and so forth are welcome. However, all performers must propose a device that measures heartrate.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOther important considerations include:\r\n\r\n1. The device should provide secure transmission to both storage and real-time display of monitored physiologic endpoint data.\r\n\r\n2. There are many existing commercial and military-optimized wearable PhysMon devices currently available.

Availability to the private sector shall also be considered as the wearable medical device and fitness-tracker industries continue to grow and more of the public purchases for personal use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe global wearable medical device and fitness-tracker market size is valued at $26.8 billion in 2022. Companies including Apple, Samsung, Google, Fitbit, Oura, and Amazon continue to develop smaller, wearable devices that incorporate physiologic monitoring. Additionally, these devices also include GPS tracking, as well as integration and linking of cell phone/cloud account (AppleID, Google account, etc.) features such as ApplePay. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCommercial applications for such technology would be healthcare providers employing wearable PhysMon devices for their patients, long-haul trucking or commercial airline industry for monitoring alert-status of drivers and pilots, and, finally, private citizens using wearables for recreational use such as fitness trackers. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSecure wireless interlinking of commercial wearables, particularly those with the capability of contactless payment, would be highly received by the public.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCommander U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Alkali atoms, particularly rubidium and cesium, are advantageous for low-size, -weight and power (SWaP) quantum sensors and clocks due to their high atomic vapor pressure, convenient microwave frequency ground state energy splittings, and strong optical transitions for state preparation and readout [Ref 1]. Unfortunately, the optical spectral lines of greatest interest for these atoms (particularly the D2 lines at 780 nm and 852.5 nm) fall at wavelengths near the low end of the NIR, so devices requiring these laser wavelengths do not benefit from the technical maturity and reliability of lasers developed for telecommunications (telecom) applications. The need for low-SWaP lasers operating at these alkali transition frequencies is currently well-served by distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and distributed feedback (DFB) devices based on a Gallium arsenide (GaAs)/Aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) platform. Lasers of this type are currently limited to operational lifetimes in the range of 10,000 hours. Many applications for quantum sensors would benefit from extended operational lifetimes, enabling extended deployments on the order of 10 years or more without requiring costly servicing operations or replacement of components.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Navy has a need for narrow linewidth, tunable NIR laser diodes in the range of 770-852.5 nm with extended operational lifetime. The increased aluminum content of the underlying epilayer material of diodes operating natively at these short wavelengths may lead to defects which reduce laser efficiency and reliability, ultimately shortening laser lifetime. Possible approaches to improving the performance of GaAs/AlGaAs devices include designs that reduce the aluminum content in active gain regions [Ref 3]. Alternative approaches to improving laser reliability include frequency-doubling a more mature, long-lifetime diode operating at a telecom wavelength [Ref 4], but this architecture requires development and miniaturization to remain SWaP-competitive with native frequency diodes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: For a Direct to Phase II topic, the Government expects that the small business would have accomplished the following in a Phase I-type effort and developed a concept for a workable prototype or design to address, at a minimum, the basic requirements of the stated objective above. The below actions would be required in order to satisfy the requirements of Phase I:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Innovative approaches to the design of miniature packaged diode based lasers \r\n\r\n\u2022 Operational lifetime exceeding 100,000 hours. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Candidate laser technologies must be capable of single frequency operation (linewidth under 1 MHz), \r\n\r\n\u2022 Must have the ability to be frequency-tuned to cover at least one atomic transition in the range of 770-852.5 nm (such as the Rb D2 line at 780.2 nm), \r\n\r\n\u2022 Must produce high output power (> 100 mW) in a single transverse spatial mode. \r\n\r\nSWaP efficiency of proposed approaches should be similar to that of existing commercial DFB/DBR devices.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design, fabricate, package, and characterize a production run of high-reliability diode-based lasers meeting the linewidth, power, and tunability performance goals stated above. Lasers should be designed for nominally room temperature operation (20-30 \u00b0C). Any innovations relating to laser design and manufacture, from epitaxy through packaging may be considered in order to meet a threshold mean time to failure (MTTF) of 100,000 hours at nominal operating temperature (with a goal MTTF of 200,000 hours). An accelerated aging study shall be performed to assess the predicted lifetime of prototype devices, and a report summarizing results and methodology should be provided. A suitable laser package shall be identified for prototype laser delivery. By the end of Phase II, five (5) packaged lasers shall be delivered for testing. Each delivered device should pass initial burn-in tests, and should be characterized in terms of power and efficiency (light-current-voltage curve). Each delivered device must also be characterized in terms of its ability to be tuned over one alkali spectral line in the range 770 nm to 852.5 nm. The prototypes should be delivered by the end of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The laser designs and fabrication processes developed in Phase II will enhance the reliability of quantum sensing and timekeeping systems. Support the Navy in transitioning the technology to Navy use. The prototypes will be evaluated through optical characterization and testing with relevant quantum sensing or timing systems. The end product technology could be leveraged to support both military/strategic applications as well as commercial applications. Military applications include optical atomic clocks and GPS denied navigation aids for long-duration missions such as quantum gravimeters and magnetometers. Additional commercial applications for these systems include resource exploration, geosensing, mapping, timing, time transfer for telecommunications, and deep space navigation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tKitching, John. \u201cChip-scale atomic devices.\u201d Applied Physics Reviews, 2018, 5, 031302. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5026238\r\n\tMcGilligan, J.

This \u201cwargaming cloud\u201d will harness the American democratic and competitive ethos to both train our service members in the operational warfighting \u201cfamily business\u201d and crowdsource the development of potentially disruptive operational strategies. The dataset created through this effort will enable both traditional data analysis methods and more modern approaches based on machine learning and artificial intelligence.\u00a0\u00a0 SBIR phases will seek a warfighting game that balances playability, DoD relevance, and data extraction capability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Our proposal aims to build an initial repository of operational wargames designed to educate every allied warfighter on the intricacies of the operational level of war while enabling statistical analysis and AI-informed decision-making through significant quantities of game iterations.\r\n\r\nLeveraging public and popular games, the SBIR awardees will produce a large dataset from their existing online servers from which military planners could derive decision analyses at the appropriate operational level. Further, if not already developed, SBIR funds should develop a Markov Decision Process dataset for reinforcement learning applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally, SBIR awardees will provide plug-in capabilities to their games which allow for the DAF to adjust and create novel scenarios and assets. These plug-ins will provide extensibility and adaptability for future in-depth data-driven strategy analysis.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFurther, utilizing these gaming platforms, our approach will allow every airman and guardian to test their operational instincts against the best tacticians worldwide, fostering a sense of pride, competition, and ownership while teaching the family business of warfare.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe datasets that are created via these games will populate a gameplay database, which can be used to analyze trends from worldwide player data, develop alternative strategies from that data, and train AI agents.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese trained AI models will enhance the high-level traditional wargaming process in three primary ways.\u00a0 First, it will add fidelity to adjudication by actually simulating tactical level encounters based on moves, rather than the current process of having \u2018white cell\u2019 declare an outcome based on a spreadsheet, dice-roll, or rule of thumb.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSecond, it will greatly accelerate logistics and laydown planning, which provides re-playability.\u00a0 One initial early finding from the adoption of Command:PE was that human planners only started taking risk and exercising creativity after the \u2018conventional\u2019 plan had tried and failed multiple times, but when they did they were able to actually start winning scenarios that were assumed losses.\u00a0 Replayability gets human players into a place where they can produce these valuable outcomes - if the work-hours required to run a traditional wargame only allow for one rep, bold concepts and disruptive approaches may not get a hearing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLast, AI agents can provide the ability to \u2018MoneyBall\u2019 diverse approaches to wargaming and planning.\u00a0 \u2018Anti-fragile\u2019 strategies that incorporate both chaos and order is a strong suit for a free society, especially against an authoritarian regime.\u00a0 Since logistics planning is a necessity, this form of modeling would allow for enough branches to make space for mission command at echelon, which will in turn impose costs on an adversary well prior to conflict.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn order to pursue these objectives, three goals must be met by the AI modeling effort:\r\n\r\n-1) Tactical modeling.\u00a0 The ability for AI agents to model tactical encounters in a relevant wargaming system, which will provide a rigorous tool for adjudicating operational-level wargaming moves.\r\n\r\n-2) Logistical modeling.\u00a0 Given a combat desired force in a scenario, AI agents can model one or ideally several scenarios for basing and logistical support.\r\n\r\n-3) Operational modeling.\u00a0 (stretch goal) Given an operational design, complete laydown, tactical encounters, and operational level branching in order to provide a \u2018strawman\u2019 initial analysis of a concept of operations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis proposal supports the requirement for DAF warfighters to be educated about real operational threats. Further, this will provide the ability for warfighters to better assess strategies, tactics, and procedures against thinking and adaptive opponents. In so doing, this SBIR will help prepare DAF members to be ready to deploy and fight (OI 7) while ensuring an operational understanding of JADC2 (OI 2) and enabling the analysis of alternatives for resilient forward-basing options (OI 5).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEngaged Stakeholders: AFWERX Spark, AFIMSC, Morpheus, Air Force Gaming, Lincoln Labs, DAF, MIT AIA\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The objective of Phase I is that projects will demonstrate their game\u2019s playability, DoD relevance, and data extraction capability. The team is seeking games that can balance abstraction and realism, sufficiently mimicking the operational level of war for warfighter education and human evaluation while maintaining high levels of engagement and playability. Additionally, games will demonstrate their ability to export gameplay data that fully and efficiently captures in-game experience for a broad gamut of post processing. In this feasibility study, companies will demonstrate their capability of data extraction.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II will focus on game flexibility, scaleability, and capability demonstration with real gameplay. In addition to Phase I goals (playability, relevance, and extraction capability), performers will demonstrate the commercialization potential of their game (more data to capture for AI agent training), their ability to host their game on government servers and provide a continuous stream of data during the PoP from all hosted games. Additionally, performers shall give the USG the ability to extend scenarios with user-defined assets, inject AI agents as players, and permit faster-than-real-time command-line gameplay suitable for agent training.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The future of gaming will require extensible, AI-ready games capable of employing cooperative and competitive agents as NPCs. The ability to inform the development of these agents using real gameplay data from experienced users could be invaluable. These capabilities for small game companies improve the reach, enjoyability, and accessibility of their games to the worldwide market. In ensuring their games are AI-ready, games will improve their marketability for future research and development to unique markets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tVinyals, Oriol, et al. \"Grandmaster level in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning.\"Nature 575.7782 (2019): 350-354.;\r\n\tMeta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team (FAIR)\u2020, et al. \"Human-level play in the game of Diplomacy by combining language models with strategic reasoning.\" Science 378.6624 (2022): 1067-1074.;\r\n\tSiu, Ho Chit, et al. \"Evaluation of human-AI teams for learned and rule-based agents in Hanabi. \"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 16183-16195.; \r\n\t\u00a0Lyons, Joseph, et al. \"Measuring Perceived Agent Appropriateness in a Live-Flight HumanAutonomy Teaming Scenario.\" Ergonomics in design (2022): 10648046221129393.;\r\n\t\u00a0Silver, David, et al. \"Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search.\" nature 529.7587 (2016): 484-489.;\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Wargaming, Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479827","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Real-time magnetic field generator for hardware-in-the-loop testing","branch":"Air Force","topic_number":"AF241-0002","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Hypersonics\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

The system required will interface with existing magnetic field emulation hardware to provide calibrated phenomenology representative of the vector field induced by the Earth\u2019s crust and other dynamic environmental sources as sensed by aerospace platforms performing a wide range of Air Force missions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: An active area of research in AFRL is the use of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field variations as a means for navigation. This technique is thought to be used in nature by animals during long migrations and has been explored by AFRL, MIT, and others as a possible alternative to conventional GPS-based guidance. Given the interest in this area, AFRL has also been exploring development of laboratory simulation capabilities for the purpose of testing navigation systems as an integral part of the guidance and control of aircraft, weapons, and other aerospace assets. This type of navigation research and development is enabled by digital simulations and real-time Software-In-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation environments. Recently, the Kinetic-kill Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (KHILS) facility at Eglin AFB developed a 3-D vector field simulator, the Magnetic field Navigation Integration Testbed (MagNIT) to demonstrate HIL capability for future Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) technologies. While much progress has been made, challenges remain in development of the simulator control system, i.e., User Interface for simulator configuration and calibration, Real-Time Simulation Engine for accurate real-time field generation, Run-time Interface development, environment and self-induced Field Contamination Modeling, and Data Logging.\u00a0 Essential to this capability will be review and implementation of magnetic field models to form the basis of simulations. Numerous magnetic field models exist, e.g., the World Magnetic Model, the Enhanced Magnetic Model, International Geomagnetic Reference Field, etc. One challenge for testing will be to establish maturity and robustness of navigation algorithms that are trained on databases that are known to be continuously changing over time. Another challenge is calibration to deal with the laboratory environment and establishing what facility controls and modifications are necessary to provide an accurate test environment. Another is emulation of fields induced by the sensing platform as it dynamically performs a mission, rapidly changing attitude and altitude using electrically driven control systems and actuators. These processes, along with the more fundamental User and Facility interface functionality, must be instantiated and demonstrated under this activity. Validation test cases are required to demonstrate accuracy of the simulator and viability of the simulation process. The described capability must be adaptable to operate in a digital signal injection mode, an analog signal injection mode, and as a driver for the existing KHILS MagNIT HIL simulator.\u00a0 Innovative solutions, based on demonstrated experience in GN&C, HIL Testing, E-M Phenomenology, Calibration processes, and Software Development, are desired to develop and demonstrate effective and efficient processes for validated magnetic field simulation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tEstablish simulator functional requirements and modes of operation.\r\n\tDocument facility interface requirements and characterize the test facility environment.\r\n\tResearch available databases to use to present sufficiently accurate and relevant crust magnetic field data at altitudes of interest.\r\n\tEstablish Use Cases and range of vehicle dynamics.\r\n\tResearch validation data sets for assessing simulator calibration accuracy.\r\n\tDocument range of potential airframe induced interference magnitudes and dynamics and potential modeling strategies to represent dynamic fields resulting from servos, motors, etc.\r\n\tDevelop and build a prototype system to demonstrate baseline functional capability at TRL 4.\u00a0 \r\n\tDemonstrate software externally driven with an appropriate flight profile and using playback of canned flight profiles interfaced to the MagNIT, or an appropriate emulation, with data logging.\r\n\tBuild a plan to improve performance, fidelity, and integration into simulation frameworks in order to interface with sensors and the AFRL owned MagNIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tBuild improved prototype of the magnetic field generation controller with User Interface and full operational functionality (TRL 7). \r\n\tDemonstrate all calibration functions in connection to the MagNIT to validate facility constraints and/or modifications and upgrades required to meet future test requirements.\r\n\tDemonstrate real-time operation using 6DOF state data from a HIL simulator through an appropriate interface. 1) Demonstrate magnetic field vector sensor emulation for injection into a processing system, as in a software-in-the-loop simulation. 2) Demonstrate driving the AFRL owned magnetic field generation system (MagNIT). \r\n\tExecute validation test cases and document results with all developed procedures and solutions.

Melting permafrost and coastal erosion creates a much less stable environment for transportation and infrastructure.\u00a0 When operating any electronic equipment in the Arctic region, the equipment must be able to withstand extremely cold temperatures, corrosive environments, and damage from sea life like Polar Bears and Arctic Foxes who are known to rip apart or play with buoys in the ice (Author\u2019s experience).\u00a0 Because of this, the Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR) is particularly reliant on ground-based line of site systems to provide rapid access, reach, and air domain awareness in the AOR.\u00a0\u00a0 A solution is required that takes into account the complexities of achieving ADA in the arctic environment for both current and future threats. This Phase 1 SBIR focuses on any emerging or existing technology that can contribute to the ability to perform Aerospace Warning (AW) and Aerospace Control (AC) in the Arctic beyond the line of site ground-based systems as a connected system.\u00a0 It focuses on low-cost passive or active sensors, information, or other novel applications of traditional equipment in a broader electromagnetic spectrum range (RADAR, EO&IR, etc.).\u00a0 The equipment operating environment must be able to operate in temperatures ranges from \u201340 degrees Celsius to 10 degrees Celsius, where an average of 20-50 cm of snow fall on the sea ice in the winter, average salinity of the ocean from 32 to 37 PSU, and with relative humidities up to 100% (NSIDC).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Demonstrate a method or conduct a feasibility study that is capable of enhancing ADA in the Arctic for operational use.\u00a0 The method should employ existing and emerging sensors, services, techniques, and solutions that integrate into existing programs of record and data lakes within the Air Force and CDAO office.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Development of an observing network using one or more sensors, services, techniques, and solutions at low-cost that integrate into the operational picture for air domain awareness in the Arctic.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The contractor will pursue commercialization of the various technologies developed in Phase II for transitioning expanded mission capability to a broad range of potential government and civilian users and alternate mission applications.

These models often include coarse geometric and visible light (EO) information as textures. This project will develop algorithms that autonomously or semi-autonomously construct detailed 3D RF propagation models using available 3D geometry-and-texture, i.e., skinned, models of real-world locations. The resulting RF models will be used to develop context-specific AI technologies that estimate candidate 3D RF source locations and signal types from a low SWaP Ultra-Wide Band antenna array consisting of 4 antennas or less. Frequency ranges of interest for geolocation include 0.8 GHz - 6 GHz and solutions extending this range without sacrificing SWaP or performance are welcome. \r\n\r\nGeolocation approaches should be capable of detecting RF sources in complex multi-path environments where the strongest sensed signal may arrive to the sensor via direct-path propagation or propagation paths involving up to 2 bounces.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nGeolocation capabilities will be part of a larger Electronic Surveillance Monitoring (ESM) algorithm suite which can be deployed as downstream analysis capabilities for the payload.

answers.\u00a0 Models must be able to quickly learn from new data to improve predictions\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Aircraft survivability and ballistic test data have been collected for over sixty years.\u00a0 This data needs to be converted to a format to aid in performing data analysis and for extracting answers to assist in new test and evaluation predictions.\u00a0 With current test reports, which are often stored in Portable Document Format (PDF) for later reference, little regard is given to the usefulness of the data beyond the current project and often insufficient background information is documented along with the data to allow useful models to be created and tailored to new applications.\u00a0 In addition, new test data is often difficult to merge with this previous data without a detailed link to caveats associated with the previous testing.\u00a0 This may include future testing which may make use of enhanced instrumentation techniques able to capture higher resolution or details than data captured in previous testing.\u00a0 The lack of clarity on the past testing and the diligence required for finding and extracting the past test report data often results in duplication of effort and/or re-learning of lessons learned.\u00a0 This, in turn, leads to additional cost and time to get vital answers.\u00a0 Even when engineering level models were built upon the past test data, the addition of new test data most often results in the creation of new Monte Carlo inputs that may not properly capture parameters and constraints. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe digital engineering paradigm requires more coupon, subscale, and large-scale testing to be performed earlier to support design and trade study activities before prototypes are built.\u00a0 Much of this test data will need to come from previous test programs and be adapted to new aircraft survivability test objectives.\u00a0 With only static reports available from the past and perhaps no traceability to raw data or no accurate way to interpret that data, there is often no ability to capture all the necessary information from past testing to create useful test data products for the future.\u00a0 In addition, there is certainly no way to improve upon the past data, as additional related test or simulation data become available.\u00a0 This means that digital engineering will be

fuel spurt and more.\u00a0 Threat-related data may include flash/function probability, residual velocity, residual mass, and more.\u00a0 The data encapsulation methodology should include a demonstration of how various forms of data can be preserved, relevant variables are preserved, accurate predictions can be made, how the resulting tool can improve with additional test data, and how previously generated test data can be used for new and novel test programs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Significant work equivalent to a Phase I effort in demonstrating the feasibility of a data encapsulation methodology applicable to aircraft survivability test data must be documented in the proposal.\u00a0 The methodology must be able to integrate previous survivability test and analysis

Understanding of any HS/H system under test requires a thorough understanding of the as-delivered free stream test conditions. The test conditions are typically characterized during dedicated test runs using intrusive diagnostics such as flow-field rakes with multiple discrete probes. Currently, the probes are limited to the assessment of total pressure and temperature with no direct measurement of local static pressure or Mach number. As such several assumptions and iterative techniques are required to assess the flow-field characteristics. With only wall statics along the nozzle inner mold line, analysis is limited to assuming a uniform static pressure across the flow field. Any divergence in the static pressure from this assumption is superimposed on the total pressure and Mach number profiles. A direct measurement of either static pressure or Mach number will negate the need for the assumptions and reduce the overall uncertainty of test results.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Consult with AEDC personnel to understand APTU operations and gain familiarity with current intrusive rake and probe designs.

Recently, DoD has made significant efforts to leverage commercial 5G investments in vendors and operators that are untrusted. Those initiatives that rely on commercial 5G products, create emerging security challenges involving in data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\u00a0 Concerning the Fighting Satellite Communication (SATCOM) vision by US Space Command that requires future military SATCOM capable of multi-band and multi-waveform operations, whenever possible, to support agile, path-agnostic connectivity, reducing vulnerability to interference and jamming, this topic solicitation is to focus on potential cross-cutting areas required to integrate 5G terrestrial networks with military satellite networks. Such a realization of the enterprise satellite and terrestrial data transport capability across all joint-domain mission areas can only be achieved by means of a radical shift in the way both security and resilience of 5G are designed. For instance, a new dimension for security with path-agnostic and location privacy considerations against denial-of-service (DoS) threats would pose severe challenges to the realization of a 5G-based space data transport. Of particular interest includes but is not limited to: space data transport using cooperative and untrusted indigenous 5G networks where the U.S. and its allied spanning military operators, government services, and DoD controlled infrastructure securely operate through untrusted indigenous 5G wireless communications infrastructures whenever possible. Along with such development for novel security architecture and add-on software modules, both 5G core network and user equipment solutions are necessary to aid in evaluation of expected performance for anomaly detection and recovery, network slicing together with zero-trust protocols, integrity guarantees and covert communications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop necessary plans and concept designs for the proposed 5G-based space data transport or capability in order to demonstrate its viability. Conceptualize a secure hybrid 5G terrestrial & SATCOM system design with potential enhancements to full-stack user software solutions for user equipment and leveraging existing infrastructures. Include appropriate initial laboratory demonstrations as required.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Mature the findings in Phase I. Develop a modeling and simulation capability of a family of security solutions along with user-centric and Open Random Access Network (ORAN) that would leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning intrusion detection analytics. Perform trade studies for security and performance at user equipment and ORAN. Demonstrate a proof of concept to evaluate necessary enhancements and augmentations required pertaining to resilience against DoS threats, integrity guarantees, path-agnostic connectivity, and location privacy subject to variability of untrusted indigenous 5G networks and DoD controlled infrastructures.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Integrate with prospective follow-on transition partners to provide improved operational capability to a broad range of potential Government and civilian users and alternate mission applications. Government organizations such as Air Force Research Laboratory and Space Systems Command could sponsor a government reference design of secure 5G networks for legitimate DoD and civil users, in collaboration with small business and industry partners. Successful contractor technology demonstrations will inform the technical requirements of future acquisitions by Primes and subcontractors.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tL. You, K.

One technique for removing these electrons is to mimic nature with electromagnetic (EM) Whistler waves that are known to scatter electrons onto trajectories aligned with the magnetic field, where they are lost into the atmosphere [Starks, 2020].\u00a0 The recent DSX (Demonstration and Science Experiment) mission [Johnston, 2023] successfully demonstrated transmission by an 80 m dipole antenna and reception by a remote satellite. While DSX was able to measure the dissipated power, it was unable to quantify the efficiency of radiation versus local dissipation i.e., plasma heating.\u00a0 Since follow-on systems must be precision engineered for a required size, weight, and power, this topic calls for a numerical model capable of representing antenna concepts in realistic detail while modeling both the local plasma response and the distant radiation including the wave mode. Whistler waves can exist in a range of modes from electrostatic (ES) to electromagnetic (EM).\u00a0 Current thinking holds that EM waves are more effective at modifying the electron pitch angle since the magnetic interaction consumes no energy; while antennas that are small compared to the free space VLF wavelength (100 km) preferentially excite ES waves due to the high index of refraction that matches the wavelength in plasma to the antenna size.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Current antenna concepts include: the electric dipole such as with DSX, the magnetic loop antenna, the magnetic rod antenna; and engineered plasma modification for such (near the antenna) to produce non-linear beat wave interference and conversion from ES to EM radiation [Sotnikov, 2018].\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The end product will be a computer plasma model capable of aiding the design of a space-based antenna immersed in the low or near Earth plasma.\u00a0 This model will be capable of simulating the performance of the recent DSX antenna, a 100A 20 m diameter magnetic loop, and a compact magnetic rod producing a similar dipole moment.\u00a0 While the usual SBIR rights will apply to the model, so also will the government&#39;s limited right to effectively use the model following conclusion of the SBIR effort.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: In Phase I, the contractor will identify and demonstrate the numerical methods to be used, and at conclusion have demonstrated the viability of the approach.\u00a0 This effort is expected to be computationally intensive so a limited demonstration will be acceptable i.e., it will not be necessary to obtain production levels of super-computer access.\u00a0 Never-the-less, since super-computing is an anticipated requirement, such capability must be convincingly demonstrated\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: During Phase-II, the capability to effectively model one or more antenna concepts is expected, and a fully functional design tool should be delivered at the conclusion of Phase-II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: In Phase-III the antenna-plasma design tool will be used to design candidate systems for the radiation of radios waves at Very Low Frequency.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStarks, M.

An auto immune response system for cyber events would remove the need for constant monitoring by operators by detecting currently known vulnerabilities and then classifying unknown vulnerabilities. This system follows the operational capabilities of the human immune system to allow for long term and evolving effectiveness of the detect and response capabilities of a space platform. \r\n\r\nThe Objective of the SBIR is to research and develop algorithms and system architectures that can detect a cyber event both known and unknown using bio-inspired computing techniques.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: For an operator to be able to respond to a cyber event in a proficient and responsive timeline the event would need to be quickly detected. Classic cyber detection and mitigation systems, such as Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems, lack the ability to detect/respond to unknown attack signatures [1]. A bio-inspired immune response system complements the classic system to handle the unknown signatures, much like how the human immune system can react and handle known pathogens [1]. There exists cloud based systems, such as IBM Watson for Cyber Security [2], but those systems tend to have large computational requirements and false positive rates. Therefore future research and work would need to inter operate with existing security systems, detect unknown cyber events with high accuracy and decrease computational resources to fit within a satellites SWAP-C.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct a literature survey of bio-inspired computing and cyber immune response to understand the current state of the art. Using the survey generate a representative software and hardware architecture for use in implementing a cyber immune response system. Using the architecture create an analysis of alternatives for the key aspects of the architecture. Using the architecture and analysis of alternatives generate a list of data source needs to feed into the system to be able to generate a course of action. Given a vignette mission from the technical point of contact generate a set of courses of action that would pertain.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Operating off the phase 1 vignette and proposed architecture implement a proof of concept system that can generate actionable courses of actions in a simulated digital twin of a space platform. Using the simulation demonstrate the ability of the system to learn and respond to known and unknown threats to the platform. Using the proof of concept and simulation determine the optimal location for the response system based on data source and computational needs. Using the simulation and digital twin generate a set of mitigation techniques possible to act on the course of actions coming from the immune response system. Implement the most impactful mitigation techniques and demonstrate the ability for the system to now detect and respond to known and unknown cyber threats. Develop the proof of concept into a space ready prototype that can be tested government test space test range to determine to operational-ability of the prototype.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Entering into phase 3 the immune response system should be at Technology Readiness Level 5-6 and should be nearing Technology Readiness Level 7, based on National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#39;s Technology Readiness Levels. The performing company should now work towards getting on-board a flight test program, such as AFRL RV&#39;s small-sat, Department of Defense Space Test Program or University Nano Satellite Program.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWlodarczak, Peter. \"Cyber immunity.\" International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering.

Generation and Storage; Advanced Materials\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to improve cycle life and capacity retention of Lithium-Sulfur battery chemistry by addressing and resolving negative effects of parasitic polysulfide reactions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The current state-of-practice specific energy in 18650 Li-ion cells used in space missions is as low as 150 W-h/kg.\u00a0 Lithium-Sulfur, with its 2600 W-h/kg theoretical specific energy, has been identified as a promising chemistry to achieve for the U.S. Space Force&#39;s (USSF) short-term 18650 rechargeable battery target of 450 W-h/kg.\u00a0 A higher energy rechargeable power source would have impacts across all areas of the USSF mission to enable spacecraft resilience and survivability.\u00a0 Most practical issues with Lithium-Sulfur chemistry can be attributed to \u201cpolysulfide shuttling\u201d, the dissolution of Lithium Polysulfide in liquid electrolyte which results in parasitic reactions and its relatively low volumetric energy density, especially when in a small form factor battery cell such as an 18650.\u00a0 These reactions cause low Sulfur utilization and capacity fade, resulting in poor cycling efficiency.\u00a0 Recent efforts have been focused on either (1) suppressing diffusion of the dissolved polysulfides out of the cathode, or (2) protecting the lithium anode from reacting with the dissolved polysulfides.\u00a0 Li-S modelling is necessary to understand the technology development way-forward.\u00a0 This topic proposes the investigation of these or other methods to mitigate the inhibiting effects of polysulfide dissolution and improve its volumetric energy density.\u00a0 Findings will be incorporated into materials and 18650 cell design that can improve cycle life performance while maintaining a high specific energy intrinsic to the chemistry.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Investigate the feasibility of practical

provide an appropriate number of cell samples to conduct electrochemical performance testing to AIAA S-144-202X.\u00a0 Performance targets for deliverables include specific energy of 450 W-h/kg at the

point.\u00a0 The exceptional point in a nanophotonic system which occurs when the gain and loss are balanced.\u00a0 The resulting operational singularity radically changes the behavior of the optical system and creates large changes in system response to external stimulus.\u00a0 A macro scale ring laser gyro (RLG) has sensitivity that is highly dependent on the optical ring resonator loss and the enclosed path length that the light travels.\u00a0 Operation of a nano scale RLG at an exceptional point promises to overcome the limitations of the very short optical path length.\u00a0 Utilization of the behavior singularity at the exceptional point is only possible due to recent developments in exploiting gain/loss properties in nano scale waveguides.\u00a0 To develop a nano scale RLG which operates at the exceptional point, you first need a nano scale RLG which operates in the standard regime of parity-time (PT) symmetry.\u00a0 Once that is achieved, the design can be manipulated to reach the point where parity-time symmetry breaks down and operation is at the exceptional point.\u00a0 This effort supports development of the PT-symmetry chip level RLG as well as error modeling for a future RLG operating at the exceptional point.\u00a0 The project will attempt to leverage advances in gyro technology to enable better than navigation grade performance from a single channel gyro with a one cubic inch volume.\u00a0 The final design should target 1 W per active channel for power consumption.\u00a0 The technology employed will need to be radiation hardened in the future.\u00a0 Target ARW is 0.005 deg/rt-hr.\u00a0 Bias stability at constant temperature target is 0.05 deg/hr at 30 minutes.\u00a0 The gyro dynamic range will be up to 10 deg/s.\u00a0 Performance must be maintained through TBD g acceleration in any orientation relative to the gyro sensing axis.\u00a0 Gyro scale factor nonlinearity from 1 deg/sec to 10 deg/sec magnitude will be less than 10 ppm after

gyro (RLG).\u00a0 Further investigation into what is required to push the design to the exceptional point will be done.\u00a0 While the concept of an RLG operating in the mode is still at an early stage of development, it is desired to assess the practical aspects of operational use of the device.\u00a0 For example, operation at the exceptional point (EP) requires high bandwidth servos to assess where is the EP is and to keep the gyro at that point.\u00a0 Behavior on either side of the EP is drastically different than at the singularity itself.\u00a0 Models should be developed to assess expected instrument output in the presence of EP control loop error.\u00a0 Temperature sensitivity could be quite high.\u00a0 Models should be developed to assess required temperature stability of the nano-optical substrate needed to maintain EP operation.\u00a0 Phase I will design a sensor which demonstrates 50% of the required static environment performance.\u00a0 Brass board electronics without flight representative size are acceptable.\u00a0 The sensor form factor will be flight representative.\u00a0 Meeting the 50% static performance goal with a 1 ci sensor volume is a challenging task and will enable assessment of the technology\u2019s suitability to meet the higher performance goals.\u00a0 Error models of the sensor shall be presented which show a path to the target static and dynamic performance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II will produce a sensor which satisfies the complete performance requirement.\u00a0 Error models described in Phase I would be enhanced to account for measured characteristics of the functional device.\u00a0 The supporting electronics should be small enough at the end of Phase II to be able to be mounted on a 24\u201d rate table platter to facilitate dynamic testing.\u00a0 Error models should be sufficiently developed to be able to provide a realistic prediction of gyro noise, gyro bias stability, and scale factor non-linearity.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The prototype gyro and Phase II electronics will be tested in an actual dynamic environment with DC rate, AC rate, and reasonable temperature diurnal.\u00a0 The data will be used to validate behavioral models from Phase II.\u00a0 Testing of this type can be performed at The Aerospace Corporation if the small business does not

This time lag can result in critical information about maneuvering satellites to be delayed in sharing with analysts who monitor the space object population.\u00a0 While the optimal solution involves observing all maneuvering satellites persistently, such a solution is not feasible.\u00a0 The best case is therefore for analysts to detect, characterize, and identify satellite maneuvers as soon as new observation data is collected.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSolutions are sought that enable space object maneuver detection with limited latency once new observational data has been acquired.\u00a0 This will aid in maintaining persistent awareness of on-orbit objects.\u00a0 The problem is further compounded by the various orbital regimes in which important space assets reside, and the various sensor phenomenologies that dominate that regime.\u00a0 Solutions that bridge various orbital regimes, allowing for a comprehensive all-space solution are preferred to regime-specific solutions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop solution methodology.\u00a0 Conduct analysis of alternatives, propose solution, and develop algorithm.\u00a0 Algorithm should be implemented in prototype simulations against synthesized or real data to demonstrate potential for success.\u00a0 Assess computing requirements necessary for Phase II effort.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Fully develop and implement solution methodology as prototype software.\u00a0 Methodology should be tested against real-world data across multiple orbital regimes.\u00a0 Quantify performance across multiple sensor types including variations to noise and sensing cadence.\u00a0 Compare timeliness of detection and characterization performance to legacy methods.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III efforts may include integration of solution into operational test environments for evaluation with real-time data feeds, and transition to operational users.\u00a0 Military applications include more timely and accurate conjunction assessment and threat awareness.\u00a0 Expected TRL at Phase III entry is 5.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tB.

Maximum utilization of readily available resources in the field it to be utilized in order to minimize transportation weight, deployment time, and destruction for withdrawal time. Technology should be about to be transportable on aircraft with minimal footprint.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Currently, military personnel must bring equipment with them to austere environments in order to fortify their fighting position. For shorter durations, the sandbag is the most likely fortifying material to be utilized by personnel in the field. Additionally, the sandbag serves a pivotal function in long-term defensive applications. The basic sandbag requires ready access to dirt, sand, or similar earth material that be excavated to fill the bag and then it is arranged in a manner to provide a makeshift protection wall. Of particular interest are technologies that can reduce the employment time of sandbags or completely replace the sandbag system with a comparable system that provides equal, or better, levels of protection for personnel. Currently, the sandbag is manually filled with some in-field improvements that have been created by personnel. However, even with these manual creations, the process of filling and deploying sandbags is extremely time consuming, which increase personnel fatigue and reduces defensive capabilities. Improvement points may include, but not limited to: prefilled sandbags that fully deploy under certain conditions, lightweight systems capable of rapidly filling sandbags, lightweight systems capable of quickly deploying multiple sandbags, or a total sandbags replacement system. Further, the systems need to be minimal in size and weight to reduce cargo size and weight such that impact for transportation is minimized.

These run the spectrum from cockpit dials and digital interfaces, to portable maintenance aids on laptops and tablets. To enable AR systems to capture that data for reference and logging, the sponsoring organization needs a machine vision system capable of observing an interface in various poses and extracting data from it. Key to scaling this capability will be a no code tool for a maintainer to train the system on a small number of example pictures that they can label. During maintenance the machine vision utility will integrate with other work tracking tools to record and reference the data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The next major goal for AR/VR systems is AI and ML to support work as it is performed. This requires a large data set to effectively develop. The sponsoring organization requires a framework to capture multidimensional data from AR/VR systems to create and sustain a corpus of data for development and refinement of ML/AI algorithms. This framework should integrate into cloud based storage concepts and be rapidly adaptable to new AR/VR systems as they develop. The work tracking itself is done in software which will be important context to the data and should be included in the framework. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSafety Assistant AI\r\n\r\nMaintenance work on weapon systems frequently involves exposure to hazardous conditions, hot surfaces, pinch points, loud noises, etc. Initial, scalable development of an AI agent that can alert the maintainer to observable hazards via an AR system is of interest.

With the work procedures digitized into a machine comprehensible form and the maintainer stepping through them in either AR or VR, the next enhancement is for an AI to be able to recognize the work that has been accomplished and assist with logging or proceeding to the next step. This enables virtual instructors and AI assistants to be developed from examples of the work being performed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

Specifically, the prototype should aim to identify vulnerabilities in AI/ML models, such as adversarial examples, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks. Additionally, it intends to propose innovative defense mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of these attacks. The research will also investigate the trade-off between the effectiveness of defense mechanisms and the computational resources required for their implementation. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the security and resilience of AI/ML models, thereby increasing their reliability and trustworthiness for real-world applications. There is an immediate demand for this capability across strategic, operational, and technical guidance and policies mandated by the Secretary of the USAF as follows: \u2022 Operational Imperatives\u00a0\u00a0 o II - Achieving Operationally Optimized Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) / Air Force Joint All-Domain Command & Control (AF JADC2) o IV - Achieving Moving Target Engagement at Scale in a Challenging Operational Environment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The significance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has grown in various military applications. However, the susceptibility of AI/ML models to adversarial attacks has raised concerns regarding the security and reliability of these models in C2 real-world applications. Adversarial attacks involve deliberate attempts to manipulate or deceive an AI/ML model by introducing carefully crafted inputs that cause the model to misclassify or produce incorrect outputs [1]. Such attacks can have severe consequences in safety-critical applications like autonomous agent route planning or medical diagnosis, and they can also result in privacy violations and data breaches. The most prevalent form of adversarial attack is the generation of adversarial examples, which are inputs slightly altered from legitimate inputs but can cause the model to produce incorrect outputs. Adversarial examples can be created using various techniques, such as gradient-based methods or evolutionary algorithms, and they can be challenging to detect and defend against. Other types of adversarial attacks include data poisoning, where an attacker injects malicious data into the training dataset to bias the model towards a specific outcome, and model extraction, where an attacker attempts to steal the model&#39;s architecture or parameters to replicate or enhance the model. Consequently, the development of effective techniques to secure AI/ML models against adversarial attacks has become imperative for operational performance within the USAF. Therefore, this proposal seeks innovative prototypes to engage and deter cyber threats under AI/ML models, which will incorporated into the Air Force\u2019s core operational mission.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: s this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

The scope of the phase I feasibility study should include at minimum research on identifying vulnerabilities in AI/ML models, such as adversarial models, data poisoning, and model extraction attacks and others securing AI/ML techniques innovative defense mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of these attacks as the minimum basis for qualifications for this phase II solicitation proposal.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system.

This topic undertakes the operational imperatives as follows: \u2022 Operational Imperatives o II - Achieving Operationally Optimized Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) / Air Force Joint All-Domain Command & Control (AF JADC2) o V - Defining optimized resilient basing, sustainment, and communications in a contested environment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: RL represents a groundbreaking technology with the ability to perform long-term decision-making in complex and dynamic domains at a level surpassing human capabilities [1]. Leveraging this capability holds immense strategic significance for the United States Department of Defense (DoD), given that RL-enabled systems have the potential to outperform even the most exceptional human minds in a wide range of tasks [2]. Its adoption in high-risk real-world domains like military applications has been limited due to the challenges associated with explaining RL agent decisions and establishing user trust in these agents, despite remarkable improvements. For instance, while the AI AlphaStar competes against highly skilled StarCraft 2 players, comprehending its inner workings necessitates extensive and impractical empirical investigations [3]. This substantial and inhibitory constraint arises because current Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods inadequately address the fact that autonomous decision-making agents can alter future data observations through their actions and effectively reason about long-term objectives aligned with the agent&#39;s mission. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective XRL approaches that overcome these limitations to unlock the widespread utilization of RL&#39;s capabilities. Therefore, we seek to have proposals that would adhere to effective and efficient models for XRL, which will be used for the US Air Force\u2019s direct operational use.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

The sensors should be designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions and provide reliable and accurate data in real-time. The use of robotic dogs or UAS would enable efficient and safe deployment of the sensors to remote or difficult-to-reach locations. The sensors should be lightweight and compact, enabling easy transport and deployment by the robotic dogs or UAS. The goal is to enhance surveillance and monitoring capabilities in challenging environments where traditional methods of deployment are not feasible or safe.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The system must be capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional data collection methods that are often hindered by hazardous conditions or difficult terrain, thereby minimizing the risks and increasing efficiency. The mobile sensor system has the potential to revolutionize data collection by providing a reliable solution that can access locations that were previously inaccessible, enabling critical insights into environmental conditions and security threats. The system must consist of lightweight and compact sensors that can be easily transported and deployed by robotic dogs or unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The sensors must be designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, ensuring reliable data collection in challenging environments. The system must also integrate with navigation and positioning technology to ensure accurate data collection. The sensors must be able to collect data in real-time and transmit it wirelessly to a central location for analysis. The development of a custom robotic dog or UAS platform is crucial for the successful implementation of the mobile sensor system. The platform must be designed to be lightweight, compact, and durable, enabling it to navigate rugged terrain and harsh environmental conditions with ease. The robotic dog or UAS platform must be capable of transporting and deploying the sensors in difficult terrain, thereby reaching previously inaccessible locations. A robust wireless communication system is necessary for transmitting data from the sensors to a central location in real-time. This system must ensure that the data collected is transmitted quickly and reliably, providing real-time insights into environmental conditions and security threats. The system must also be secure and resilient, ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized access or interference. Data analysis software must be developed to process, analyze, and visualize the data collected by the sensor system. This software must provide critical insights into environmental conditions and security threats, enabling informed decision-making. The software must be designed to be user-friendly, allowing non-experts to easily interpret the data collected.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

This includes addressing any issues or limitations in the current system and exploring new capabilities that could enhance the system&#39;s effectiveness and versatility. Once potential areas for improvement have been identified, the development team will create a plan to design and test the new capabilities. The team will conduct rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and compatibility of the new capabilities with the existing system. Throughout the development and testing process, the team will collaborate with security forces personnel to ensure that the new capabilities meet their needs and can be effectively integrated into existing operational procedures. Ongoing training and education for security forces will also be necessary to use the new capabilities effectively.

These systems provide great improvements in safety, quality, agility, and throughput metrics. This growth shows no signs of slowing down.\u00a0 As these systems are scaled across more locations, the issue that needs to be addressed is the dynamic nature of the depot environment. In the depot environment, toolboxes move daily, work stands are continuously repositioned, and people must be present when these robotic systems are performing their work.\u00a0 The use of industrial robotics for aircraft maintenance operations currently requires very controlled (static) and well-protected \u201ccells\u201d that give the robot a place to work where it understands its surroundings and protects/prevents humans from entering that cell. This can severely limit where these robots can be used, and the safety devices used take up valuable floor space. In the case of mobile robots, this is even more difficult. These systems are designed to move from building to building, meaning there must be \u201csafe cells\u201d in each location so the systems can be used in those buildings. This multiplies the lost space problem by the number of buildings the robot has the potential to operate in.\u00a0 With the proper sensing and controls in place, these systems will be able to function efficiently in dynamic environments and allow for safe interactions with humans. Existing technologies allow the interaction between humans and industrial robots, but again only in very static and controlled situations. The development of this technology will allow this interaction to expand outside of the \u201csafe cells\u201d, making industrial robotic systems (especially mobile systems) even more agile and impactful for all production sectors in governmental and private manufacturing areas.\u00a0 The discrete defense need addressed in this will be more effective and more reconfigurable industrial layout designs and utilizations, hence enhancng thoughputs such aircraft and other weapon system availabilities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

Unlike Phase I submissions, Direct-to-Phase II offers extended time and allocated funds, enabling companies to better meet the Government\u2019sour specific prototype requirements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: AFDO leadership are looking to establish a tool for this organization\u2019s newly owned requirement of handling the Department of the Air Force (DAF) Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) program. MDRs may either be requested direct from a public requestor or referred to DAF (AFDO) for review from another government agency, based on potential Air Force equities. AFDO reviewers must conduct a line-by-line review and provide specific alignment to Executive Order 13526 based on the appropriate exemption selected in Security Classification and Declassification Guides (SCDGs). \r\n\r\nWith this newly acquired program, there is a large backlog of cases for AFDO to review, task out to other organizations/agencies, all while new cases continue to trickle in. Given the typical content of the requests from the public and other government agencies, the sponsoring organization has a need to:\r\n\r\n- Respond to requests in a quicker manner;\r\n\r\n- Provide consistency & accuracy during the document review;\r\n\r\n- Identify similar topics from previous cases that may apply in the future;\r\n\r\n- And identify potential equity of other organizations/agencies during intake of the case.\r\n\r\nThe sponsoring organization\u2019s current process is almost entirely manual, therefore this topic\u2019s focus is to truly enhance the review process altogether, while ensuring compliance with mandated standards.

To be straightforward, commanders are not going to trust a tool unless they understand how and what data their system was trained on, and how decisions are made to execute an operation [5]. There are still numerous unresolved inquiries surrounding the enhancement of GenAI&#39;s capabilities and operator-friendliness. One such open inquiry: how can we enable explainability, allowing operators to grasp and form a clearer mental model of GenAI? Recent research conducted by Goodfellow et al. [2] and Ross et al. [3] has delved into the development of more explainable GenAI models that align with human-understandable processes. However, a comprehensive perspective on explainability of GenAI model such as ChatGPT is still missing. That begs another question: what does an operator need to understand/trust about a GenAI model easily to achieve his/her goals during operational use? Because of these unanswered questions about the model to build trust and transparency within the warfighters\u2019 system usages, it is imperative for the DoD operations to develop a system accordingly [4].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTherefore, this SBIR topic seeks proposals to develop a DoD based trustworthy GenAI (described above) system that will not only provide ChatGPT like information but also perform to structure data effectively and deliver/explain accurate insights/decisions about the system to build trust between an operator and a GenAI model. Additionally, proposal should address which uncertainty they are trying to solve such as epistemic or aleatoric in developing/utilizing GenAI based large language models (LLM).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

The candidate applying to this solicitation will provide proof of having at least two or\u00a0 more of having extended, explored, analyzed or used ChatGPT in an applicable/similar case scenario that is being explored in the objective of this topic to utilize/develop GenAI models (e.g., transformer-based models, variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks (GAN), deep reinforcement learning (DRL)) on C4 systems to structure data, and deliver accurate insights of these systems to explain the decisions made by these models to develop trust between the models and an operator.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: This direct to phase description will seek to directly implement the objective of this topic setforth as to develop an efficient prototype based on a prior feasibility study to utilize/develop GenAI models (e.g., transformer-based models, variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks (GAN), deep reinforcement learning (DRL)) on C4 systems to structure data, and deliver accurate insights of these systems to explain the decisions made by these models to develop trust between the models and an operator. Performers will develop design and specifications and implementation to demonstrate a\u00a0 \r\n\r\nsuitable prototype to proof the explainability factor of\u00a0 GenAI models to create trust between the models and an operator.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III efforts will focus on transitioning operationally ready technology to a commercial sector or DoD environment.

The proposed effort is focused on maturing the technology to be able to provide additional measurements of ambient temperature, density, angle of attack and sideslip as well as true airspeed on high performance aircraft in regimes faster than the speed of sound.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nAll aircraft rely on accurate air data measurements to either be used by the pilot, or to be used by more complicated aircraft with flight control systems. These air data measurements typically include altitude, airspeed, ambient temperature, angle of attack (AoA), and angle of sideslip (AoS). Pilots will target altitudes and airspeeds for tasks such as takeoff, approach, and landing. Being at the correct speed ensures safe handling characteristics while being at the correct altitude ensures safe clearance from the ground and obstacles. Flight control systems will schedule inputs based on the flight computer&#39;s understanding of the aircraft&#39;s airspeed, AoA, and AoS. Whether used by the pilot or the flight control computer, accurate air data measurements are essential to the safe operation of aircraft.\r\n\r\nTypical air data systems rely on combinations of probes that extend from the aircraft and flush static ports. Unfortunately, these systems cannot measure the ambient conditions because either the probes, or the aircraft itself distorts the flow. So providing accurate air data measurements by existing means requires careful consideration during the design phase. Even with careful design considerations, the overall flight test campaign still requires costly and dedicated flight test time and techniques to determine the errors associated with their installation.\r\n\r\nOptical Air Data Systems (OADS) use lasers to interrogate the air mass without physically disturbing the flow. OADS effectively provide the necessary information free from errors associated with traditional pitot-static or flush air data systems. Several efforts have demonstrated this capability, but only in subsonic environments and none have actually compared the accuracy of OADS to currently accepted methods. Aircraft that travel in the transonic to supersonic regimes create larger disturbances and OADS would have to interrogate packets of air across a shock front.\r\n\r\nInitial evaluations of overall accuracy will be performed with the OADS integrated into a flight test pod installed on a specially modified F-16 test aircraft, known as a Pacer, that can make precise air data measurements. Air data measured by the OADS would be compared to the solution provided by the F-16 Pacer. On subsequent test efforts, the OADS would be integrated into a larger bomber type aircraft for evaluations of suitability and utility as flight-test-specific instrumentation and as primary aircraft equipment replacing traditional air data systems.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I:\r\n\r\nThis is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made because of this topic. To qualify for this D2P2 topic, the Government expects the Offeror to demonstrate feasibility by means of a prior \u201cPhase I-type\u201d effort that does not constitute work undertaken as part of a prior SBIR/STTR funding agreement. Offerors are expected to provide a white paper providing a comprehensive feasibility assessment that outlines the technical viability of using Optical Air Data Systems (OADS) for flight-test-specific instrumentation and primary aircraft equipment at speeds more than the speed of sound and at altitudes up to 50,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis assessment should address the suitability of the systems for accurate air data measurements and their potential integration into different aircraft platforms. Additionally, I expect Accuracy Testing, where the contractor conducts initial evaluations of the overall accuracy of the OADS as implemented in wind tunnel environments. Offerors should specify the testing methodologies and procedures to ensure precise air data measurements during the evaluations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Data Analysis is essential, and I anticipate the Offerors to conduct a thorough analysis and provide meaningful conclusions about the accuracy, suitability, and utility of the OADS as flight-test-specific instrumentation and primary aircraft equipment. Lastly, I also expect a rugged integration of the OADS into the flight test pod, which will be installed on a specially modified F-16. The Offerors should then demonstrate how the system can effectively be integrated into several aircraft design structure and predict its performance in real-flight scenarios.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: \r\n\r\nThe proposed effort is focused on maturing the technology to be able to provide additional measurements of ambient temperature, density, angle of attack and sideslip as well as true airspeed on high performance aircraft in regimes faster than the speed of sound. As a result, the Phase II Period of Performance objectives:\r\n\r\n1. ) Integrate Optical Air Data System into a flight test pod to be carried on an F-16.\r\n\r\n2. ) Collect flight test data used to evaluate the Optical Air Data System against the Air Force Test Center&#39;s specially modified Pacer F-16.\r\n\r\n3. ) Evaluate the suitability and utility of Optical Air Data Systems to serve as a flight-test-unique truth source of air data measurements.\r\n\r\n4. ) Evaluate the suitability and utility of Optical Air Data Systems to replace the primary air data system in lieu of traditional pitot-static or flush air data system. Success criteria includes gathering information on the measurement of the following five air data measurements throughout the flight envelope of the flight test pod as installed on an F-16 and through the flight envelope of the large bomber type aircraft.\r\n\r\nAir Data Measurements:\r\n\r\n1. ) True Airspeed\r\n\r\n2. ) Ambient Pressure\r\n\r\n3. ) Ambient Temperature\r\n\r\n4. ) Angle of Attack\r\n\r\n5. ) Angle of Sideslip\r\n\r\nAs integrated on to the F-16, operating parameters are from zero to 50,000 feet Pressure Altitude, and zero airspeed up to 1.2 Mach Number. The operating parameters for the large bomber type aircraft will depend on the platform selected.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: \r\n\r\nPhase III would transition this type of hardware to be the primary means of measuring air data parameters on aircraft to replace traditional air data installations. Phase II is expected to increase the TRL of this technology to a 7-8 prior to entrance to Phase III. Stealth aircraft and hypersonic platforms would be able to eliminate thousands of hours of design and development on flush air data systems typically used in these applications. Additionally, these aircraft would be able to eliminate required dedicated flight test efforts to calibrate said systems. Additional commercial applications extend to airliners for detecting Clear-Air-Turbulence (CAT). CAT is not typically associated with weather phenomena and is much more difficult to detect and avoid. The National Transportation Safety Board reported 197 turbulence-related accidents between 2009 and 2018, all caused serious injuries. Nearly 30 percent of these accidents were caused by CAT. Optical Air Data Systems can potentially be used to detect CAT with enough advanced notice to avoid the area and prevent accidents.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1.

Aircraft maintainers envision enhancement of two systems: one which measures the thickness of paint on a metal or composite substrate and one which serves as an Eddy Current Non-destructive Testing system. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCorrosion Control professionals use a variety of systems (e.g., Eddy Current, Ultrasound, X-ray) to detect problems, but these systems do not share a common interface, cannot save results associated to a particular aircraft, and can be unwieldy to handle while scanning and recording results manually.\u00a0 Most systems cannot export data; they only show video on other monitors.\u00a0 There is limited ability for remote experts to support maintainers without traveling to site.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAircraft maintainers estimate an AR-integrated Paint Scanning system would increase aircraft maintenance production efficiency by 15-25% and throughput of additional aircraft per year per system to a similar degree, directly improving readiness of aircraft fleet.\u00a0 The NDI Eddy Current integrated system is estimated to deliver 15-25% increase in efficiency, 10% or more improvement in detection accuracy, 10% or more improvement in end user safety, and cost savings.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAircraft maintainers\u2019 grand vision for such an integration approach is to arm the maintainer, supervisors, and quality personnel with a suite of AR-enabled corrosion control detection and measurement systems, each with data associated to the aircraft tail number and available at all times for review through the AR headset, enabling an unparalleled capability to toggle through data to fully understand the current and historical corrosion profile of the individual aircraft as well as inform larger analyses of recurring issues and corrosion trends across the fleet.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: FEASABILITY DOCUMENTATION.\u00a0 For this Direct-to-Phase II topic, evaluators are expecting that the submittal firm demonstrate the ability to have proven feasibility of importing data (not just video) from multiple detection systems into an AR platform, present data, and store data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Contractor will integrate a minimum of three Corrosion Control systems with a single AR platform, tag scan data in 3D space to a particular tail number, enable features by user type (maintainer, supervisor, etc.), and toggle through results without rebooting or reorienting the system. User interface will be simple and intuitive. Applications will share a common look and feel. Data will be exported to a digital twin on a phone, tablet, and/or PC. Live data from the AR system can be shared with other users. AR platform displays data for entire aircraft, not individual parts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Contractor will operationalize the Phase II prototype, obtaining Authority to Operate, developing an API or Plug-in to allow additional Corrosion Control system integrations, productizing AR and enabling components into a kit and obtaining National Stock Number(s), and offering sustainment options.

There is an ongoing need for a loitering munition capable of striking such mobile targets. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMobile targets present different challenges than standard fixed targets as they require the munition to account for rapid movements up to the moment of strike.

These challenges are compounded for the military, where standoff range and safety are imperative to protect both ground and air assets. Current methods used by the Department of Defense are capable but too expensive to proliferate in the force.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo allow use anywhere in the world, the system needs to be capable of being airdropped from both the C-130 and CV-22. Airdrop will require solutions for the structure of the air vehicle to survive the forces undergone during safe separation. This will also require the airdrop package or other delivery method to meet relevant safe separation standards and be capable of fitting within the cargo areas of both aircraft. The autopilot should provide the ability to set or change the coordinates by loadmasters onboard the aircraft prior to the deployment. The system will not be controlled or updated once launched and does not require anti-jam capabilities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLong standoff ranges allow higher operational safety for both the aircraft and receiving party. Any system to be considered should be appropriate for normal airdrop missions for CV-22 and C130s and capable of performing the mission in light winds. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo be considered, proposals must make every effort to reduce unit cost. The threshold is $30k per unit for 100 units with an objective of $10k for 100 units. This low-cost goal allows for proliferation in mission sets where current capabilities simply would not make sense for one-time-use delivery assets. Any system to be considered must provide accurate cost proposals detailing how their unit cost is calculated and achievable. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn order to align with Operational Imperative 7 (See Ref 1), Readiness to Deploy and Fight, a system need to be developed that allow for transportation with preexisting support systems.

Active UAS combat in various parts of the world provide lessons learned and new tactics for UAS and Counter UAS operations teams to experiment with. Tactics include silent flight, mass attack, complex diversion and simple swarming. More dynamic smart swarming employed manually by human control or machine piloting is beginning to emerge and will continue to increase in complexity over the next few years.\r\n\r\nMany Counter UAS solutions have attributes that allow adversaries to game them and still complete their mission of disrupting DoD military operations or causing loss of life or military equipment. This topic is focused on developing modern concepts that can detect multiple UAS outside the wire and stop them using techniques that are independent of threat speed, altitude, flight path, PNT and inter swarm coordination techniques. These concepts can include air and ground sensors, ground and air launched effectors and air surveillance outside of the wire.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are significant complexities in all phases of the kill chain and not all these problems can be solved under this topic. This effort is focused on effect on adversary operations and how those effects can evolve or morph throughout an engagement to prevent an adversary from successfully adjusting their tactics (speed, altitude, autonomy) to complete their mission. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct-to-Phase 2 (D2P2) topic.

After forming, the part is typically heat treated to make it harder and applicable for use on an aircraft. The process of heat treating tends to warp the part, requiring the part to be placed back in/on the forming machine (called re-striking). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRobotic incremental metal forming provides a perfect use case to heat treat the metal in place directly after the forming process. This eliminates requiring the part to travel to another shop and another piece of equipment and greatly simplifies the re-striking process.\u00a0 Additionally, sourcing certain sheet metal stock with the appropriate starting heat-treated state can be challenging, increasing the associated lead times to form parts and have them installed on aircrafts.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn-place heat treat capability, given that it allows for the heat treat state of the sheet stock to also be manipulated prior to forming, can mitigate this issue.\u00a0 Comprehensively considered, an in-place heat treat capability would make operations more efficient, effective, and safe.\u00a0 These attributes would be realized through a much-lessened logistical footprint, on-time attention per part, and utility input per part.\u00a0 The additional process would also greatly enhance net capacity to produce in surge production and other potential scenarios.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

The United States Space Force (USSF) uses Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches to acquire new systems, including the delivery of System Modeling Language (SysML) format of architectures and designs. The USSF is also building digital ecosystems and Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) capabilities to simulate the employment of space systems through the use of digital models. The USSF needs new model-generation solutions to automate and standardize the creation of new digital models from existing static-based documentation of legacy systems that are not already represented in model-based formats. This will enable the integration of diverse Space Platforms in a common digital environment for warfighting simulation to predict and evaluate the Space Order of Battle.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

Alt-PNT can augment GPS or serve as a short/medium-term alternative to GPS if access to GPS signals is denied or degraded.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Military/Civil/Commercial users require resilient, integrated, high-precision PNT information in contested environments for vehicle autonomy and other emerging fields. This Alt-PNT effort seeks to leverage both government and commercial investments to develop and demonstrate technology to provide resilient navigation and timing information, either from novel sources or by integrating PNT information from existing sources in novel ways to enhance resilience. The scope of this effort includes provision of Alt-PNT services, hardware, software, and associated enabling technologies and approaches. This solicitation seeks proposals at the level of: Systems-of-Systems, System, Critical Item, and/or Device, which lead to Alt-PNT capability. Proposals may include Alt-PNT technologies and implementations needed within the domains of Alt-PNT Control systems, Space Segments, and User Equipment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThere are many Alt-PNT implementations that can provide PNT information independent of GPS, including (but not limited to): non-GPS space-based RF systems including global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), self-contained inertial navigation systems (INS), celestial navigation, computer vision-based approaches, network-based timing approaches, PNT-over-communications, signals of opportunity, and other land-based RF augmentation systems. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSeveral recent commercial efforts provide opportunities to increase PNT resilience through Alt-PNT. Those developments include: low cost proliferated LEO (pLEO) communication mega-constellations, low cost reusable launch vehicles, machine learning and artificial intelligence, quantum sensing, low cost high data-rate space laser crosslink networks, chip scale atomic clocks, very high density reconfigurable field programmable gate arrays, Graphical Processing Units, as well as the convergence of satellite communications and 5G/6G cell networks. These developments provide an overarching technological opportunity to enable all new alternative navigation services, completely independent of existing MEO GNSS systems.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlt-PNT enablers are also of interest, including: low-cost, zero-trust, long-range, space-space networks, GNSS Situational Awareness, Integrity/Authentication Monitors, provision of GNSS Hot-Start data, global timing synchronization, and resilient C2 capability for PNT systems. These enabling capabilities address how Alt-PNT systems can be integrated with future heterogenous, multi-tier, highly integrated space assets to provide the resilient PNT.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

The solution can facilitate rapid development of vaccines against any emerging infectious threats to protect civilian and military personnel against infectious diseases and reduce lost duty days.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Emerging pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential are a significant threat to US Forces that defend the homeland and US interests abroad. Historically, highly pathogenic novel viruses have impacted continuity of operations of US Forces with grave consequences. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted operations, training, and military readiness across all services and has introduced quarantine and isolation challenges to the US Fleet carrying out freedom of navigation operations in the Pacific. It is imperative to develop, validate, and field an agile vaccine platform that can be rapidly adapted to produce a preventative countermeasure for the next emerging disease threat to US forces. To that end Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC) has developed a psoralen/UV-A based whole virus inactivation method in laboratory scale [1, 2]. NMRC has also developed and optimized a two-step chromatographic method to obtain highly purified psoralen inactivated whole virus vaccine candidates in large quantities to conduct preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy evaluations. We have prepared highly purified monovalent and tetravalent psoralen-inactivated dengue virus vaccines (DENV PsIVs) and a psoralen-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 PsIV) vaccine candidate and evaluated their immunogenicity, efficacy and safety in animal models [3, 4]. Psoralen-UV-A based inactivation method can be easily adapted to develop whole cell inactivated vaccines against any pathogen including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and has a great potential as an agile vaccine platform to rapidly develop vaccines against emerging infectious threats.\u00a0 Based on the preclinical immunogenicity data NMRC is currently working on establishing a contract with a commercial manufacturing organization to make SARS-CoV-2 PsIV under cGMP conditions to conduct a first in human Phase 1 clinical trial. However, our efforts to manufacture the GMP product is hampered by lack of a suitable psoralen/UV-A inactivation device for effectively inactivating pathogens at large enough volumes (10 mL \u2013 50 L batches) under cGMP conditions. The prototype device developed in this SBIR topic should have the capability to inactivate pathogens in 10 mL to 50 L volume using psoralen and UV-A irradiation and the ability to adjust and optimize the parameters such as flow rate of the pathogen solution into and out of the UV-A irradiation chamber, time of UV-A irradiation and the total UV-A energy applied to the pathogen solution for achieving a complete pathogen inactivation without degrading the antigenic proteins. Availability of such a high-throughput psoralen-inactivation device for manufacturing the GMP product will significantly advance the psoralen-inactivated whole cell vaccine platform as an agile vaccine platform against emerging infectious diseases. This pathogen inactivation device can also be used for rapid inactivation of pathogens requiring high containment (BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories) without degrading their surface proteins and antigens before bringing them out of the BSL-3 or BSL-4 lab for antigen discovery and characterization.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The main goal of Phase I is a feasibility study towards developing a prototype high throughput UV-A irradiation device capable of handling 10 mL to 50 L volume of pathogens at high titers (greater than 1011 PFU or CFU per mL) while uniformly delivering the UV-A energy to the pathogen solution to achieve complete inactivation of the pathogen. NMRC Tech Transfer office and NMRC legal will work with the small business to license or otherwise distribute prior technology findings from NMRC to awardees at no cost. The proposed psoralen-UV-A irradiation should be a flow through inactivation device with inlets for pumping psoralen/pathogen mixtures into to the UV-A-irradiation chamber with a control the flow rate, and capable of uniformly delivering the UV-A energy to the entire psoralen/pathogen mixture as it flows within the UV-A chamber, and an outlet from the UV-A irradiation chamber to collect the psoralen/UV-A processed inactivated pathogen into an appropriate bioprocessing container for downstream vaccine development processes. The prototype device should include the software and control switches necessary to regulate/adjust all the parameters including flow rate, stop and start flow, amount of UV-A energy applied (microjoules/second/cm2), and the time of application of UV-A energy. The design should include selection of tubing and materials that are low binding to ensure minimal loss of biological material during the inactivation process. Device design should allow for adjusting the total inactivation volumes of pathogens as required.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase I deliverables:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tData demonstrating flow-through inactivation of 10 mL \u2013 5 L of a virus, using psoralen-UV-A irradiation-based pathogen inactivation method/device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The main objective of Phase II is to develop and produce a fully functional prototype high throughput UV-A irradiation device that is capable of handling 10 mL to 50 L volume of pathogens at high titers (greater than 1011 PFU or CFU per mL) while uniformly delivering the UV-A energy to the pathogen solution to achieve complete inactivation of the pathogen. The major components of the device should include a) an inlet to add specific amount of psoralen derivative to the entire volume of the pathogen, b) an inlet to the UV-A-irradiation chamber and a pump to control the flow rate, c) the UV-A irradiation chamber capable of uniformly delivering the UV-A energy to the entire pathogen solution contained within the UV-A chamber, d) control switch to regulate/adjust the amount of UV-A energy applied to the pathogen solution, and an outlet from the UV-A irradiation chamber to collect the psoralen/UV-A processed inactivated pathogen into an appropriate bioprocessing container for downstream vaccine development processes. The prototype device should include the software and control switches necessary to regulate/adjust all the parameters including flow rate, stop and start flow, UV-A energy applied (microjoules/second/cm2), and the time of application of UV-A energy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nPhase II deliverables:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOne fully functional prototype psoralen-UV-A irradiation-based pathogen inactivation device with data demonstrating complete inactivation of 50 L of Dengue virus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The main target of this high throughput psoralen/UV-A irradiation-based pathogen inactivation device is the GMP vaccine manufacturers who will be making the whole cell inactivated vaccines. Whole virus inactivated vaccines occupy a large proportion of the global viral vaccines market since they elicit a broad range of immune responses and have several advantages including safety and relatively low production cost.\u00a0 The global inactivated vaccines market is expected to increase by more than 10% from 2022 to 2027 (https://www.globalmarketestimates.com/market-report/inactivated-vaccine-market-3754). Formaldehyde and \u03b2-propiolactone, the chemicals currently used for making whole virus inactivated vaccines, are less than optimal since they alter the immunogenic proteins and are considered carcinogenic. Psoralen compounds on the other hand do not affect the immunogenic proteins and have been shown to be safe for use in biopharmaceutical applications. Therefore, after successfully delivering the prototype device and completing this SBIR phase II, the vision is for the small business to make a commercially viable psoralen/UV-A-based inactivation device by partnering with vaccine manufacturers. This device can be marketed for making psoralen-inactivated vaccines against a broad range of diseases caused by viruses including influenza, poliovirus, hantavirus and rabies virus. Availability of such a high-throughput psoralen-inactivation device for manufacturing the GMP product with a basic instrument manual with operating instructions to regulate/adjust the device parameters and anticipated troubleshooting guidelines (in accordance with FDA guidelines) will significantly advance the psoralen-inactivated whole vaccine platform as an agile vaccine platform against emerging infectious threats.\u00a0 This pathogen inactivation device can also be marketed for rapid inactivation of contaminants during biopharmaceuticals production such as recombinant proteins and other therapeutic agents. It can also be marketed to academic and environmental scientists for inactivating high containment (BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories) pathogens without degrading their surface proteins and antigens before bringing them out of the BSL-3 or BSL-4 lab for antigen discovery and characterization.

Such a solution must be readily accessible at the point of injury and designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, enabling use by non-medical personnel for self-aid and buddy care scenarios.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Exsanguination from massive blood loss accounts for more than 80% of potentially survivable battlefield deaths [1]. A junctional tourniquet solution would address the 32% of these fatalities that arise from uncontrollable extremity and junctional bleeding [2]. Junctional tourniquets apply external compression to stop blood flow in the groin and axilla, i.e., at the junction of the trunk and the appendages. Junctional indication demands precise placement and, ideally, single-point pressure. The tourniquet design must ensure user accuracy in high-stress situations. Currently, four designs meet FDA approval and have shown effectiveness in occlusion under controlled conditions [3]. This topic seeks a form factor that allows for fast and easy application by non-medical personnel with minimal training. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen proposing a technology, consider the following factors: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe device should be able to control a junctional bleed within about one minute as operated by a trained user.\r\n\tIdeally, a well-designed junctional tourniquet can replace the use of an extremity tourniquet.\r\n\tThe total weight of the device should be under 1.5 lbs. The stored volume should be no more than 500 cubic inches to remain minimal for transport and individual warfighter use. \r\n\tThe design should be amenable to one handed use.\r\n\tEngineer the device to efficiently manage both upper and lower junctional hemorrhage through compression of axillary and femoral arteries, respectively.\r\n\tEnsure the device&#39;s availability at the point of injury, i.e., it must be able to be commonly carried.\r\n\tUse of the device shall be simple with minimal steps. Anatomical knowledge should not be required for operation of the device. Device shall not require more than 2 hours of standardized training.\r\n\tThe tourniquet design should address stability over time, including factors such as physiological response to hemorrhage, type of uniform, surface conditions (blood or rain) and transport. \r\n\tThe materials should have the ability to withstand dirt/dust/sand, UV exposure, fresh and salt water, hot and cold temperatures, requiring minimal special storage conditions. \r\n\tEngineering solutions should require minimum logistical/technical support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of framework properties/technology capabilities desirable for both Department of Defense/Government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase I-type effort: conduct a study to determine the technical feasibility (as demonstrated through clinical data, benchtop testing, etc.), end-user human factors testing and an initial design of a junctional tourniquet.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: During this phase, the offeror will advance the system towards TRL 4, refining it from a proof-of-concept. The design should be optimized for efficacy and qualitative and quantitative hemorrhage control outcomes should be demonstrated to include metrics such as the time to apply to occlusion and percentage of successful occlusion attempts (i.e., how does the tourniquet fit different anthropomorphic types). Testing and evaluation of the prototype to demonstrate operational effectiveness in simulated stressful environments should be demonstrated. Stability of the product over time (to include considerations for physiological response to hemorrhage, type of uniform, surface conditions (bloody or wet) and transport) and survivability of the materials under extreme conditions (heat, cold, wet, UV and dirt/dust) should be demonstrated. Draft application instructions, procedures, technical specifications, and training materials should be provided for technical and end-user evaluation. A major criteria for acceptance by the end-user will be a favorable form factor in order for the device to be carried at all times. The offeror should plan to deliver fifteen example prototypes at the end of the Phase II effort for Government evaluation. The offeror shall articulate the regulatory strategy and provide a clear plan on how FDA clearance will be obtained.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The goal of this phase is to secure an FDA approved device and demonstrate effectiveness and usability for the military and civilian end-user. Funding from either a non-SBIR Government source (e.g., Navy Advanced Medical Development, U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity\u2019s Warfighter Expeditionary Medicine and Treatment Project Management Office, Marine Corps System Command, Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program), the private sector, or both should be investigated to develop the prototype into a viable product for sale in military and/or private sector markets. Civilian end-users can include police, fire and medical first responders, hospitals, air ambulance and evacuation, recreational medical services such as lifeguards and ski patrol, and emergency management agencies. Scenarios requiring junctional tourniquets can include automobile and motorcycle accidents, industrial accidents, mass shootings, terrorist incidents and natural disasters.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tNaimer, S.A.

To develop a manufacturing framework to rapidly produce personalized, human-usable braces and splints with no-to-minimal manual intervention. The solution can accelerate musculoskeletal injury recovery, reduce the need for medical evacuation, and facilitate Warfighter readiness, while mitigating the impact on logistics and storage limitations in military environments and medical treatment facilities.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The DoD lacks the capability to rapidly manufacture rehabilitation devices and equipment in areas where space and/or storage requirements are minimal.\u00a0 Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKIs) are the largest burden of injury for the U.S. military [1]; with 85% of service members medically evacuated following an MSKI not returning to theater [2]. Rehabilitative braces and splints are commonly used to manage and rehabilitate MSKIs. Braces and splints provide partial rigidity to protect and stabilize an injury, while still allowing some movement where needed. Current off-the-shelf braces and splints come in various sizes and designs for different body parts, sides, and injuries. The quantity potentially needed presents a significant challenge for adequately stocking these items where, when, and for whom they are needed. Currently, specific braces are manufactured, selected, transported, and stored, based on anticipation of how many of each type of brace will be required. This is of particular concern in military environments, particularly deployed and maritime care settings, where space may be limited, and the need exists to improve the medical readiness of someone with minor injuries. There is currently no role of care requirements; however, this technology is envisioned in a Role of Care 2/en route care setting.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditive manufacturing can reduce the logistical burden of transporting and storing an array of medical supplies. Currently, applications of 3D printed technology are growing in popularity within medicine [3], with applications in orthopedics being used for personalized implants and customized prostheses [4]. As 3D printing advances, it may provide innovative solutions, such as becoming a more personalized and accessible option than off the shelf bracing/splinting [4]. The desired end stage product/system will be able to rapidly manufacture personalized braces and splints onsite and on-demand for MSKI to accelerate recovery, reduce the need for medical evacuation, and facilitate Warfighter readiness. Desired products contain both flexible and semi-rigid elements, depending on the nature of the injury.\u00a0 Moreover, the ideal solution should have the potential to provide an array of bracing/splinting products across various MSKIs to promote Warfighter return to duty.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, the offeror must be able to demonstrate and provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described in Phase I has been met and describes the potential commercial applications. Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nCompleted Phase I efforts should demonstrate research and development towards a rapid fabrication solution for personalized bracing or splinting technology that requires minimal manual intervention.\u00a0 Feasible and practical solutions have the potential to combine the rigidity of personalized 3D-printed elements with flexible textiles, garments, or similar materials.\u00a0 Completed efforts should additionally demonstrate research and development towards a solution that can be customized based on user anthropometrics for braces/splints to be worn for lower and/or upper extremity musculoskeletal injuries. The fabrication framework is expected to minimize the logistical footprint and be used within a setting with access to power.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Design and develop the practical implementation of the system that incorporates the previously completed Phase I methodology toward a technology that can rapidly, and optimally generate personalized braces or splints with minimal manual intervention. Product development can be an innovation of existing technologies. Semi-rigid elements combined with textiles or soft materials and fastening or securing materials make up the key design elements.\u00a0 Designs should be capable of personalization to user size and anthropometrics, injury location, right/left side.\u00a0 They should also be capable of personalization based on requirements for mobility (e.g. semi-flexible to semi-rigid). Input requirements (manual measurements, scans, etc.) are not pre-defined. Testing and implementation should be relevant to Warfighters who have sustained an upper and/or lower extremity MSKI. The framework/system begins with a scan or computer-based inputs and the output is the final brace/splint.\u00a0 The user inputting the data or scans may be a clinician. The end recipient is the injured patient. The test-case for the output of this Phase II will be a single ankle brace/splint and hand/wrist brace/splint as a proof of concept, with a request for a physical prototype. The Phase II development should focus on a clinician interface for personalization inputs and the rapid-manufactured, personalized bracing/splinting solution outputs for human-usable production. Technical specifications should focus on a framework that can fit (dimension and weight-wise) on a table/desk and are expected to produce a product in an operational environment. Material selection considerations for environmental exposure during hot and cold weather operations should be considered.\u00a0 Frameworks that have the potential to interface with additive manufacturing systems that are multi-purpose are desirable. Systems can expect to be supplied by a standard 120V/60Hz outlet. The offeror shall articulate the regulatory strategy and provide a clear plan on how FDA clearance will be obtained.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The goal of this phase is to secure an FDA approved device and demonstrate effectiveness and usability for the military and civilian end-user. Finalization and validation of the prototype and terminal system involves producing comfortable, durable, and easily applied braces/splints that adhere to similar biomechanical outcomes as off-the-shelf models. The target market should be the commercial market for sustainability. The final commercialized product will likely integrate into a clinical practice setting, account for coding/billing requirements, complete cost/benefit analyses, identify training/education requirements (if needed), and account for socialization/broader outreach.\u00a0 Expected dual use of the end-product may extend to the needs of civilians and individuals post-military, such as orthopedic and VA rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers with limited overhead, remote care settings, mobile care units, sports medicine, and other physical medicine situations. Thus, procurement by the government is likely post-commercialization by industry. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMSKIs are an immense burden in global healthcare and present a significant challenge to military readiness; therefore, innovative technology that has the potential to provide a rapid, personalized brace/splint to accelerate recovery and shorten the period in which a Warfighter can return to duty is desirable.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tU.S. Army. 2020 Health of the Force Report.

A low-cost sensor that accurately measures oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and provides immediate feedback that Service Members can use to improve fitness, refueling practices, body composition and readiness. If fielded, may require additional security measures. Designs that limit connectivity to Bluetooth (BT) are discouraged.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The wide prevalence of metabolic dysfunction, emanating from low physical fitness, low physical activity, and obesity, is a public health concern and a national security issue across all service branches and phases of a military career, including recruitment, retention, training, deployment, and retirement from service [1,2].\u00a0 The military needs new ways to optimize metabolic health of the nondeployed force and ensure sufficient and consistent warfighter fitness levels.\r\n\r\nAthletes tailor their daily diet and physical activity routines to optimize metabolic health, body composition and physical performance [3]. Service members could do likewise, guided by actionable information provided by a personal non-invasive metabolic measurement and tracking device. Such a device would use a classic technique known as indirect calorimetry where volumetric rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) are measured, and metabolic energy expenditure and metabolic fuel selection (fats versus carbohydrates) determined.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nProviding service members with and easy-to-use device, capable of on-demand measurements of respiratory gas exchange and determination of energy expenditure and metabolic fuel mix, would enable individuals, small military units, and the groups that support them, to design and implement personalized diet and exercise regimens.\u00a0 This individualized metabolic feedback would directly support at-risk military personnel who need to meet professional standards for body composition and physical fitness and avoid the consequences of failure which can extend to separation from service.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExisting wearable systems capable of respiratory gas exchange measurements outside of a laboratory are (a) too large, heavy (~1kg), and challenging to operate, and too expensive for routine day-to-day use by large groups of minimally trained individuals, or (b) are small and simple to use but inaccurate and/or have limited capabilities (e.g., only measure VO2, only make resting measurements).\u00a0 However, new research and improvements in O2 and CO2 sensor technology suggest a compact, accurate, simple-to-use, cost-effective and scalable metabolic measurement device for use by individuals is achievable.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is accepting Direct to Phase II (DPII) proposals ONLY. Therefore, the offeror must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above and in Phase I has been met and describes the potential commercial applications.\r\n\r\nProof of feasibility includes a wireless, wearable, low-cost personal metabolic device prototype is sought to enable hands-free on-demand VO2 and VCO2 measurements, data recording, and wireless streaming to a platform-agnostic hand-held device of data to include derived metrics (e.g., metabolic energy expenditure (EE), fuel substrate mix, respiration rate). The body-worn device should be light-weight (<300g), compact, simple to use, tolerant of rain and ambient temperatures above freezing, and capable of confirming system device gas sensor calibration by referencing ambient air O2 and CO2 concentrations. Battery life should support at least 14 h of on-demand measurements. Errors of <10% in measurement of VO2 and VCO2 from rest to high intensity exercise is desired. A rigorous case and supporting data for technical and commercial viability must be presented. Evidence that the proposed solution will be viable, with adequate risk-mitigation.\u00a0 A proof-of-concept breadboard or early prototype with key components identified and accuracy quantified by means of a metabolic simulator (e.g., mechanical breath simulator with injectable gas mixtures) is desirable. This Phase shall include a detailed discussion of the approach and feasibility of producing a prototype sensor for follow-on lab and human testing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Expected military users of the technology are both individuals desiring to track impact of diet and exercise on metabolic health and performance as well as small-to-medium military units engaged in training or mission-planning activities. Ease of use in field environments is an important characteristic of the desired technological solution. The developed technology should be durable and readily applicable in resource-limited field conditions, be designed for at least 14 hours of use before recharging of battery. Gas sensor calibration accuracy must be able to be confirmed using ambient air reference. The offeror should consider final procurement cost as well as system operation and maintenance costs, creation of instruction manuals, definition of replacement/warranty policies, and training requirements for users. A user manual is desirable.Offeror will design, fabricate, integrate and test at least two prototype wireless, body-worn personal- use metabolic devices, and demonstrate accuracy of measured (e.g., O2, CO2, respiration) and derived parameters (e.g., Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER), EE) using a mechanical lung simulator and injection of certified dry gas mixtures. The device must be suitable for use in field training environments where user(s) can stream data from the device, and record meta data (e.g., events) on the device, via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The device shall be: 300g or less; attachable to standard Army MOLLE webbing; capable of sampling breath without headgear removal; capable of making measurements from rest (peak flow < 15 L/min) to intense exercise (peak flow > 350 L/min) with a respiratory burden <2\u201d H2O; capable of simple field gas calibration check and recalibration; capable of detecting onset of breathing and storing all raw data measured; and capable of accurately measuring VO2 and VCO2 with average EE and RER errors of <10% and <15%, respectively, over a RER (VCO2:VO2) range of 0.7-to-1.2. Documentation should include, but is not limited to, technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf experimentation with human test volunteers is planned, the offeror must provide a detailed plan for compliance with all applicable rules and regulations regarding the use of human subjects, to include Institutional Review Board approval(s).\u00a0 Specifically, the proposed experimentation with human test volunteers must be reviewed for compliance with Federal, Department of Defense (DoD), and Army human subjects protection requirements and receive approval by the Office of Human and Animal Research Oversight (OHARO) Office of Human Research Oversight (OHRO) prior to implementation; this requirement derives from DoDI 3216.02 and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirement for Human Research Protection Official (HRPO) review of DoD-supported human subjects research.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrototype Requirements: Offeror will provide two physical prototypes that include the following features and specifications: body-worn; accurate O2 and CO2 measurement of expired air; accurate volumetric measurement of inspired and expired air; calculation of accurate parameters (Respiratory Exchange Ratio and Energy Expenditure); demonstration of successful Bluetooth connectivity; demonstration of adequate device storage for up to 14 hours of minute-by-minute metabolic data collection; demonstration of adequate battery life for up to 14 hours of operation; weight of less than 300 grams; demonstration of accurate measurements ranging from rest to vigorous exercise; demonstration of ease of use; demonstration of simple calibration techniques. Error rates for measurements must be < 10% for energy expenditure (EE) and < 15% for respiratory exchange ratio (RER).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III will include manufacturing planning. Markets envisioned include commercial and recreational entities responsible for performance and metabolic health with a particular emphasis on the impact of diet on metabolic fuel substrate, body glycogen (carbohydrate) stores and body composition. For both military and civilian applications the device will provide individuals with guidance regarding body weight management. optimized nutrition, and training for endurance and strength events. If the derived metrics include any diagnostic capabilities, all applicable Federal Drug Administration review and certification requirements must be met.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCommercial applications would target the clear gap between very expensive research-grade metabolic sensor systems, and inexpensive but less-capable systems with a low-cost easy-to-use metabolic sensor that provides immediate feedback to individuals seeking to improve their health and quality of life through improved physical fitness, dietary practices, and body muscle and fat mass management.\u00a0 The metabolic sensor would be a key new lightweight user-friendly resource for use in fitness facilities by personal trainers designing and monitoring specialized training and weight reduction programs. Additionally, the metabolic sensor would be used by athletes and sports teams across a wide range of sporting disciplines and age. It is expected that athletes from high school to professional would benefit from a device that provides individualized feedback to maximize training and performance. The individuals that could benefit range from athletes [3] to the large group of Americans who are either prediabetic (96 million) or diabetic (37.3 million) [2].\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMilitary physical training programs across the Joint services are potential beneficiaries of this product.\u00a0 Likely end users of the metabolic sensor are the Armed Forces Wellness Centers (AFWC), which provide programs and services that improve and sustain health, performance, and readiness of military personnel.\u00a0 The AFWC staff are active users of sophisticated wearable metabolic monitoring systems, but have a clear need for more cost-effective, accurate, and easy-to-use indirect calorimeter systems.\u00a0 Another example of where metabolic sensor systems could be used by the DoD is in support of the US Army\u2019s Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nArmed Forces Wellness Centers:\r\n\r\nhttps://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/al/Pages/ArmyWellnessCenters.aspx\r\n\r\nUS Army\u2019s Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program:\r\n\r\nhttps://usacimt.tradoc.army.mil/ACFTGuidance.html\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWei Y et al., \u201cPrevalence and Costs of Chronic Conditions in the VA Health Care System,\u201d Medical Care Research and Review, vol. 60, supp. 3, 2003, pp. 146S\u2013167S, available at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15095551/\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, \"National Diabetes Statistics Report website\", 29 June 2022, available at https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics-report/index.html\r\n\tThomas DT et al., American College of Sports Medicine Joint Position Statement.

DLA continually investigates diverse coating technologies for new or improved materials, more efficient means of their production, and more competitive domestic supply chains which would lead to higher levels of innovation in current and future systems combined with benefits to other commercial and government technology applications. In an effort to reduce costly foreign reliance and/or single points of failure, DLA is looking for domestic capability that could deposit novel metal, ceramic and organomettalic based coatings for various mililtary applications such as hypersonics, gun barrels, missile launchers, and others that could improve fleet operations and sustainment. The end goal of the project would be for the development of a domestic source that would produce industrial quantities of high corrosion and wear resistance, self-lubricating, low friction, thermallly stable coatings with a fully domestic or friendly supply chain. New and novel ideas that would allow for competitive pricing with domestically deposited coatings with novel feedstocks will have preference. Ideally, the production process would be modular and scalable.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdvanced technology demonstrations for increasing production capacity, affordability and supply chain resiliency for coating techniques and processing are of high interest to DoD.\u00a0 These areas of materials and manufacturing technology provide potential opportunities toward achieving breakthrough advances for national defense.

To this end DLA is looking for domestic capabilities and capacity to produce various different kinds of coatings including but not limited to cold spray, plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), diamond-like carbon (DLC), amorphous carbide, etc for advanced weapons manufacturing. Novel techniques that increase the domestic availability of technology for supply chain resiliency of coating materials will have preference. The ideal production process will be both modular and easily scalable. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPROJECT DURATION and COST: Proposals exceeding these limits will not be evaluated.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Not to exceed a duration of 6 months and cost of $100,000.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Not to exceed a duration of 18 months and cost of $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will consist of a full process flow including deposition technique, availability of feedstock and coating characterization. Thus delivering a solid proof of concept.\u00a0 . A preliminary economic review must be carried out evaluating the cost vs. currently available products as well as determining the cost of production when using traditional deposition techniques. An alignment or collboartion with a relavant DoD Component organzation/supplier (e.g., DoD lab, defense system program office or prime contractor) and one or more relavant DoD weapon system supply chain participants or other suitable organization is highly desirable.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II will consist of making a pilot/low-rate deposition process of coatings used in at least two weapon systems. Coatings deposited will be characterized for purity, phase, thickness, adhension, wear and tear, etc. Two (2) or more sources of coating materials will be identified and tested in this process.\u00a0 A lab-scale process should be used to confirm the estimates and provide preliminary cost and pricing data.\u00a0 A business case will be generated using both DoD and commercial markets.

DLA, as a procurement agent for DoD and all of government, understanding the cost elements are essential.\u00a0 Given that DLA procures more than $40 billion worth of items annually, a small percentage reduction in energy consumption can translate to substantial monetary savings. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nManufacturing, a cornerstone of modern economies, broadly encompasses two primary domains: discrete and continuous. Discrete manufacturing refers to the production of items such as weapons, military uniforms, etc.\u00a0 In contrast, continuous manufacturing involves non-stop processes producing goods like chemicals, fuels, and certain consumables. Regardless of the category, energy remains a pivotal input, significantly influencing the cost, efficiency, and environmental footprint of the production process.\r\n\r\nTRL 3.\u00a0 (Analytical and Experimental Critical Function and/or Characteristic Proof of Concept)\r\n\r\nTRL 6.\u00a0 (System/Subsystem Model or Prototype Demonstration in a Relevant Environment)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Central to the discourse on energy efficiency in manufacturing is the concept of value added (VA) and non-value added (NVA) processes. Value-added processes directly contribute to the product&#39;s transformation, whereas non-value-added ones, although often essential, don&#39;t enhance the product&#39;s inherent value from a customer&#39;s perspective. By dissecting the energy usage into these two categories and employing precise quantification mechanisms, manufacturers and DoD can achieve a deeper understanding and, subsequently, higher operational efficiencies.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis research is based on the following hypotheses: \r\n\r\n(1) Energy used to add value (product transformation) could be modeled analytically (either physics or chemistry based), \r\n\r\n(2) Nonvalue added energy would be a function of value-add and it could be derived either from the total energy and value-add energy or allocated using empirical techniques.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere are several databases and peer reviewed journal papers are available that shows the total energy required for various manufacturing processes.\u00a0 See References section for examples of where one could get the total energy required for various manufacturing processes.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince the value-added energy in manufacturing is based on physics or chemistry-based equations, one could make use of Large Language Model (LLM)/Generative AI to identify the representative equations, and then use the same LLM/generative AI to develop the python code.\u00a0 Relying on the vast knowledge reservoir of the LLM/generative AI, the architecture of IT could deliver continuous refinement. This adaptability ensures that it remains relevant, accommodating emerging manufacturing methodologies and integrating the freshest insights from physics and chemistry.\u00a0 Also, using GitHub, one could get support/assistance from other developers to improve the accuracy of the code.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPROJECT DURATION and COST: Proposals exceeding these limits will not be evaluated.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Not to exceed a duration of 6 months and cost of $100,000.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Not to exceed a duration of 18 months and cost of $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will consist of delivering a TRL level 3 proof of concept that will include the design of an IT system that calculates value-add, non-value-add, and the total energy for a minimum of 15 discrete manufacturing processes.\u00a0 In addition to calculating the energy required for various manufacturing processes, it should include the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy use during value-add and non-value add processes.\u00a0 This system should plan to meet all the DoD physical and cybersecurity requirements.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCollaboration with a relavant DoD Component organzation/supplier (e.g., DoD lab and/or prime contractor) and one or more relavant DoD weapon system supply chain participants or other suitable organization is reccomended.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II will build a working prototype system based on the Phase I design.\u00a0\u00a0 The prototype should address the identified discrete manufacturing processes from Phase I.\u00a0 Furthermore, it should be used to confirm the estimates and provide preliminary cost and pricing data.\u00a0 A business case will be generated using both DoD and commercial markets. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCollaboration with a relavant DoD Component organzation/supplier (e.g., DoD lab and/or prime contractor) and one or more relavant DoD weapon system supply chain participants or other suitable organization is required.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: At this point, no specific funding is associated with Phase III.\u00a0 Relationships developed and progress made in Phase I and Phase II projects should result in the ability to produce to DoD orders and organic growth of business from there.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\thttps://publications.anl.gov/anlpubs/2010/10/68288.pdf\r\n\thttps://us-west-1-02900067-inspect.menlosecurity.com/safeview-fileserv/tc_download/beb9a1d4aeb1d8ce2d2fdfb4fb637f52e8537f85f3ac8225281c2e67de92cdbc/?&cid=NC949DF232947_&rid=53a12180f385ba1d5ce1e51c044cdc97&cl=9LEI8II9B3b&file_url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mit.edu%2Febm%2Fwww%2FPublications%2F9_Paper.pdf&type=original\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: discrete manufacturing, energy use, value and non-value add, IT system, Large Language Model (LLM), Generative AI\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2479957","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Domestic Sourced or Manufactured Coal Tar Pitch to Meet Military Requirements ","branch":"Defense Logistics Agency","topic_number":"DLA241-D05","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Advanced Materials\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Leak locations are frequently buried underneath other sensitive assemblies and in tightly confined spaces, particularly in the Radio Frequency tank and acceleration region of the cyclotron.\u00a0 Finding the location of these leaks if often invasive to the sensitive system, time consuming, and unreliable.\u00a0 Once found, leaks are difficult to repair with lasting solutions due to the mentioned access difficulties.\u00a0 Radioactivity in the vacuum components due to accelerator operation further slows and complicates maintenance actions, while representing a hazard to personnel.\u00a0 An innovative solution is proposed in the development of a robotic system capable of locating and repairing leaks in the high-vacuum system with greater speed, accuracy, and durability than possible using current manual methods.\u00a0 Further benefits would include reduction in invasive maintenance to the sensitive facilities and reduction in radiation hazard to personnel.\u00a0 Feasible solutions would need to be able to operate in the radiation environment of the accelerator vacuum, navigate the small inner dimensions of the vacuum system, locate and image leaks in the predominately copper systems, weld or otherwise enact lasting repairs to the located leaks, and reliably self-extract from the vacuum system while leaving no debris and only trace gasses in the vacuum system.

Emphasis will be placed on ensuring full recovery of the robotic system from the accelerator vacuum system in case of loss of power or control.

The system must include a wafer chamber, probes, electronics, environmental controllers, safety systems, and software. The WPS must be able to handle high voltage up to 40 kV with a current of 10 A (500A pulsed) through a wafer chuck and probes and must offer a versatile environment, including a vacuum and a wide range of temperatures. In addition, the WPS should also have the capability to perform accurate and reliable measurements of various electrical parameters.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: WBG semiconductors such as SiC are the most promising materials to develop high-power devices used in a variety of industries, including automobiles, home appliances, power applications, as well as aerospace and defense [1]. As the power electronics market and needs are growing rapidly, more powerful devices allowing more voltage and current are being developed, and this effort has accompanied the evolution of WPS, including source-meter units (SMUs) [2]. For the HV wafer level tests using WPSs, the moisture around wafers must be suppressed by environmental control to protect devices and to avoid early breakdown due to arcing or a strong electric field. To safely operate at HV, Fluorinert liquid has been introduced [3]. However, the application of liquid for electrical testing limits the ability to incorporate optical and/or thermal testing. Commercial manual wafer probers for high-power devices are available to handle up to 20 kV in air or fluorinated bath [4]. A WPS for HV under vacuum is also available [5]. However, WPSs for > 20 kV under vacuum and a wide-range of temperature are not available because of limited technological maturity. The proposed topic seeks to integrate hardware and software to handle 40 kV/10 A DC (500A pulsed) in a vacuum and a wide range of temperature. The final product must include a vacuum chamber with 6\u201d-8\u201d chuck (including cooling and heating system), probes, vibration isolation table, electrical system, software, and safety system.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct a feasibility study and investigate the existing technique of HV WPS. Deliver the proposed design, circuits, simulation results, and parts list of a HV WPS that will be used to build a Phase II prototype. Propose sample types for the breakdown testing at 40 kV. The design must assure a high voltage of 40 kV and a high current of 10 A DC (500A pulsed) to test various characteristics of vertical SiC MOSFETs and diodes. The wafer chuck must be able to handle the high voltage and current. The sample chamber must provide a vacuum environment to minimize arcing and for low-temperature operation. The optical window must transmit a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) .

The package-level reliability test system shall be suitable for wide bandgap devices possessing a blocking voltage up to 40kV, including metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), insulated gate bipolar transistors, (IGBTs), thyristors, and diodes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The growing popularity of high voltage, high power electronics in the commercial and defense industry is driving the need to perform reliability and qualification testing at ultra-high voltage and power levels. While many standards exist (i.e., JEDEC, IEC, MIL-STD, etc.) [2, 3], package-level reliability test systems capable of meeting the environmental and power requirements are commercially unavailable [4, 5].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor discrete wide bandgap devices, HTGB, HTRB, H3TRB, and ALT-HTRB are some of the primary reliability tests industry has adopted for qualifying device robustness. These tests require a temperature-humidity test chamber capable of maintaining a specified temperature and relative humidity continuously, while providing electrical connections to the devices under test in a specified biasing configuration. The chamber must be capable of providing controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity during ramp-up to, and ramp-down from, the specified test conditions [2, 3]. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently, a package-level reliability test system capable of conducting HTGB, HTRB, H3TRB, and ALT-HTRB up to 40kV is not commercially available. Laboratories conducting these tests at high voltage levels must piece together measurement hardware and develop custom control software, leading to an increase in development costs and time [1].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe proposed package-level reliability test system seeks to integrate the required power supplies, measurement hardware, and control software into one cohesive system. To facilitate high volume testing, the proposed test system shall be capable of testing 80 devices simultaneously. The proposed package-level reliability test system shall be suitable for wide bandgap devices possessing a blocking voltage up to 40kV and gate threshold voltage (when applicable) of \u00b150V. The test system shall provide temperature control from 25C to 200C, and relative humidity control from 15% to 85%. The test system shall be capable of providing electrical connections to the devices under test for various high voltage packaging schemes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Perform a feasibility study on the package-level reliability test system architecture as it relates to the requirements outlined in the preceding section of this document.

The report will explicitly address the following items:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tVoltage Requirement: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for achieving a target voltage rating of 40kV.\r\n\tTemperature Requirement: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for achieving a temperature-controlled environment of 25C to 200C.\r\n\tHumidity Requirement: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for achieving a humidity-controlled environment of 15% to 85%.\r\n\tPackage Adaptability: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for adapting various high voltage packaging schemes into the test environment. \r\n\tControl Software Requirement: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for implementing the control software. The control software shall include programmable settings such as applied reverse voltage, gate voltage, stress time, current compliance, voltage compliance, and measurement readout options (e.g., threshold voltage Vth and leakage current).\r\n\tModular Design Requirement: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for enabling a modular design, where components are swappable for replacement as equipment wears out.\r\n\tSafety Requirements: The feasibility study shall describe the proposed technique for integrating high voltage interlock features and ensuring operator safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents shall deliver a report that satisfies all of the requirements outlined in Phase I. If any of the above items cannot be fully addressed in the Phase I feasibility report, the report must include relevant research and justification for their inapplicability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II will result in the delivery of a fully functional prototype developed in Phase I. The prototype shall undergo rigorous testing to ensure its functionality and safety. This includes various experiments to evaluate its performance under different temperature and humidity conditions. \r\n\r\nThe complete test system architecture shall be documented into a final report. The final report must contain sufficient technical details on the system architecture, including circuit diagrams, schematics, bill of materials, and specifications. In addition, the final report must include details on the control software, its implementation, and a user guide. Finally, the final report must include details on the mitigated challenges that occurred during the development of the test system. Once completed, the fully functional prototype shall be delivered to DMEA for evaluation of the completed test system. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fully functional prototype, a technical manual for operator-level maintenance and support shall constitute a deliverable. The technical manual shall include details for performing routine maintenance and debugging common issues.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: : Phase III will conclude with the delivery of a fully developed and verified pre-production Ultra-High Voltage Reliability Test System capable of meeting all the performance specifications described in the preceding sections of this document.

The tool should identify the section(s) of the document more likely to contain classified equities, in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 13526.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Declassification reviewers analyze historical records, in accordance with EO 13526, to prevent the automatic declassification of classified holdings. Due to the amount of material required for review each calendar year, timely reviews are essential to stay on target each month. This ensures no material is automatically declassified at the end of the calendar year prior to review. The government currently employs an enhanced manual review process with digitized paper holdings and keyword search tools to support all levels of declassification review.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Determine feasibility of applying AI/ML algorithms and tools to identify data to remain classified during declassification reviews by comparing to source documents with correct dispositions from archives, security classification guides (SCGs), and declassification guides (DGs).

Create AI/ML algorithms to better predict and isolate pages (or sections) in digitized documents more likely to contain exempted information. The solutions should capture the key areas for new development, suggest appropriate methods and technologies to minimize the time intensive processes, and incorporate new technologies researched.

Proper design of components requires mechanical property data for all temperatures that the component may experience. Performing tensile tests at high temperatures may require the use of refractory materials and cooling of tools to hold the sample, but as the temperature for testing increases, the available materials of construction for the test equipment are limited. Accurately measuring the mechanical properties of a sample at a given temperature requires that the sample specimen is as close as possible to isothermal in the region experiencing strain. Heating methods which are not limited by the thermal or electrical conductivity are preferred.\u00a0 Any cooling of the equipment used to hold the sample specimen needs a method of minimizing the heat transfer from the sample. The test method should achieve high quality data including suitable strain measurement, while maintaining uniform heating of the test sample in the gauge section during testing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Design a system to achieve high quality strain measurement data on samples from room temperature to 3000\u00b0C under applied stresses of up to 300 MPa at 3000\u00b0C. The proposed system should be capable of measuring Young\u2019s modulus, proportional limit, strain rate, and ultimate tensile stress of samples. The method of heating and proposed grip solutions must not cause any damage to the sample by chemical contamination of extraneous species, and must maintain uniform heating in the sample gauge section during testing. If Phase I does not include elevated temperature bench scale tests, thermal/structural FEA models should demonstrate structural margin in each of the test apparatus components when test sample stresses are up to 300 MPa at 3000\u00b0C.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Demonstrate that the designed system in Phase I is capable of measuring Young\u2019s modulus, the proportional limit, strain rate, and ultimate tensile stress of samples at temperatures up to 3000 \u00b0C. The designed system must be capable of measuring stresses up to 300 MPa at 3000 \u00b0C. Proposers must obtain refractory material samples and test the samples at temperatures up to 3000 \u00b0C; however, maximum stresses can be demonstrated by load capability of the test setup at temperature.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Demonstrate scalability of the testing method to maximize the number of tests possible per day.

Fentanyl's chemical scaffold is easily tweaked to alter its spectroscopic signature and evade detection while delivering similar psychoactive effects. Numerous fentanyl analogues have been identified in illicit drug products and associated with fatal overdoses. The Drug Enforcement Administration's temporary scheduling of fentanyl-related substances has mitigated the appearance of new analogues somewhat, but certain derivatives such as fluorofentanyl continue to be widespread. In addition, drug traffickers have turned to other classes of synthetic opioids such as nitazenes which can also be structurally modified into pharmaceutically active, uncontrolled derivatives.\r\n\r\nCurrently, field detection devices cannot alert users to the presence of novel compounds unless the devices have been appropriately configured.  For example, if the device is spectroscopic in nature, detection is based on predetermined libraries of specific spectral signatures associated with those substances. Libraries require updates as substances are identified to incorporate the new spectral information. If the substance has not been previously identified in the field, and has no entry in the library, the end-user will likely not receive any indication that a potentially dangerous fentanyl-related drug is present, until a sample of the seized material has been analyzed by a forensic laboratory. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that most illicit drug products encountered in the field are mixtures of multiple compounds, which may obscure the target compound's signature. \r\n\r\nThis topic seeks innovative methods to develop the capability to alert field personnel, or personnel in a controlled environment, to untargeted fentanyl-related substances in the presence of other compounds.  Note the proposed approach need not be spectroscopic; this was provided as an example of the complexity associated with detecting an unknown compound.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution should include the following requirements from a Tier 1 or Tier 2 approach:\r\n\r\nTier 1: Handheld, battery operated detector. \r\n  \u2022  Threshold performance would be classification of pure compounds that might not yet be included in standard libraries (e.g., suspected synthetic opioid, not necessarily the precise ID). Sample preparation should be minimal, no more than dissolution of sample into a solvent. Processing time should be no greater than 5 minutes. \r\n  \u2022  Optimal performance would be classification of suspected narcotics that are present in low-dose forms (e.g., tablet formulations), say less than 1% composition by mass. Minimal sample preparation. Processing time should be no more than 1 minute. \r\n  \u2022  Software solutions applied to existing hardware (such as an algorithm for a Raman detector) would be considered, with the same threshold and optimal requirements.\r\n\r\nTier 2: Portable detector that is moveable by a single person without wheeled assistance.\r\n  \u2022  The weight should be less than 40 pounds, 120 VAC power, and rugged enough to be moved without maintenance (e.g., optical realignment).\r\n  \u2022  Threshold performance would be identification of pure or nearly pure unknowns without a previous library entry. Samples should have minimal preparation beyond dissolving into solution. Processing time should be less than 5 minutes. \r\n  \u2022  Optimal performance would be identification of unknown narcotics, that is, new synthetic opioids, in cut mixtures, such as tablet formulations. Minimal sample prep, processing time should be less than 1 minute. \r\n  \u2022  Detection limits for unknowns should be for at least 1% of the sample composition.

These data are incredibly valuable to DHS and our R&D partners to support the development of next-generation detection algorithms, like those used at airports for on-person and accessible property screening in order to detect explosives and prohibited items. Currently, any data that is collected must be hand-annotated and stored on physical hard disks. This process is extremely time and labor intensive, while limiting DHS's ability to develop curated data sets and share data with R&D partners. R&D partners must also accept the data in the formats and labels that were hand created, as DHS does not currently have the capability to rapidly re-annotate or reformat existing data sets.\r\n\r\nDHS is seeking innovative techniques to accelerate and bring additional flexibility to DHS's data collection, labeling, storing, and distribution processes. The current state of the art relies heavily on human labeling and knowing desired metadata and curation schemes a priori. Successful solutions will limit the amount of human intervention required to perform these tasks, instead relying on automatic software to process most routine activities. It is assumed that the provided solution may include certain commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) modules, but the focus of the research should be on novel data ingestion, labeling, and curation techniques.

The dispatchable location information is associated with the VoIP number whenever a subscriber places a 911 call to request for emergency services.\r\n\r\nVoIP telephone equipment works when connected to the internet and therefore offers subscribers the flexibility to relocate their VoIP service from one address to another. Given VoIP service complements the mobile phone service, when there is a lack of cellular coverage at a home or business, VoIP can serve as an important backup to a cellphone when connecting to the 911 Emergency Call Center (ECC).\r\nA problem arises when a VoIP subscriber moves from one locality to another and fails to update the VoIP service provider with the new physical address that is necessary for dispatching emergency personnel. Calls placed by the VoIP subscriber to 911 will be routed to the wrong 911 ECC based on the outdated address record, resulting in lost time to dispatch emergency personnel.\r\n\r\nBy one estimate, the state of California reported 1,687,529 calls were placed using VoIP to 911 ECC in 2022, or 6% of all 911 calls. Even a small fraction (assuming 5%) of the VoIP lines having issue with dispatchable location in the state of California would have resulted in tens of thousands of calls that would not be routed to the correct 911 ECC. DHS S&T has confirmed with the state of California Office of Emergency Services that VoIP 911 calls that were routed incorrectly due to lack of updated and verified dispatchable location remains an on-going challenge for 911 ECC.\r\n\r\nVoIP vendors and public safety need a solution to address the problem of maintaining updated and verified dispatchable locations. The proposed solution should enable the VoIP service providers to address the key requirement mandated by the FCC and provide a dispatchable address for VoIP subscribers\u2019 access to 911 services. The service provider must identify whether the service is being used to call 911 from a different location than the Registered Location and, if so, either: (i) prompt the customer to provide a new Registered Location; or (ii) update the Registered Location without requiring additional action by the customer.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution should include the following requirements:\r\n  \u2022  Determine dispatchable location for 911 services (e.g., using caller\u2019s current GIS location).\r\n  \u2022  Detect a change in physical location from which a subscriber's VoIP equipment is connecting to the internet for telecommunication services.\r\n  \u2022  Adhere to all relevant regulations and standards (including those referenced below).\r\n  \u2022  Privacy preserving \u2013 storing data.\r\n  \u2022  Access management that provides authorized administrators ability to perform query and collect system performance data.\r\n  \u2022  Interoperable with legacy 911 and NG911 systems for the purpose of supplying dispatchable location for the VoIP calls. \r\n  \u2022  Meet a minimum availability of 99% of up time. \r\n  \u2022  Access to the location database of the legacy 911 system, or if available, the NG911 system. \r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2477003","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Software Defined Radio for Public Safety (SDR-PS)","branch":"Science and Technology Directorate","topic_number":"DHS241-004","topic_description":"Communication is paramount for first responders (firefighters, EMS, and law enforcement) to ensure effective mission response, coordination of resources, and ensure officer/agent safety during emergency operations. First responders, including officers of DHS Components (Customers and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, US Coast Guard, US Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency), often work in locations where access to network infrastructure is unavailable. For example, incident response in remote areas may be beyond the reach of existing network infrastructure. Additionally, during disasters or major incidents, networks may be congested or unavailable for use, resulting in a lack of communications. \r\n\r\nThe current solution requires first responders to carry both land mobile radios (LMR) and broadband devices to allow operations on infrastructure (Cellular Networks). Although this solution offers resiliency, it is cumbersome and impractical to carry multiple devices. It also does not address all the critical communication needs during emergency responses. Another issue with the current solution is that traditional LMR radios are a long-term investment of at least 7-10 years and does not adapt as readily to changing technologies and advanced communications evolution.\r\n\r\nIndustry defines software-defined radio (SDR) as a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented using analog hardware, are instead implemented by means of software and digital hardware on a personal computer or embedded system. SDR can tune to different frequencies and process various signals, from FM radio to 5G, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. SDR enables flexibility, reconfigurability, and interoperability of wireless systems, as well as a lower cost and power consumption. \r\n\r\nThis topic seeks a novel approach to SDR for public safety that addresses the needs of first responders while providing flexibility, reconfigurability, and interoperability to maximize the value of radio investments.\r\n\r\nThe proposed SDR-PS solution should:\r\n  \u2022  Support communications on and off network infrastructure.\r\n  \u2022  Allow for critical transmission on multiple bands and systems due to failed infrastructure or severe congestion.\r\n     o   For example, operation could allow for transmitting alert or emergency messages on several bands and systems either in parallel or sequentially with location.\r\n  \u2022  Allow operation over multiple modes (device-to-device meshing, provide range extension at fringe areas).\r\n  \u2022  Address the critical communication needs of first responders, to include emergency broadcasts, multiple users and channels.\r\n  \u2022  Consider where and what conditions the system must operate under; Extreme heat and cold, moisture, ruggedized to support: impact from dropped/tossed, scrapped, or heavy weight.\r\n  \u2022  Allow for operations in ultra remote areas by providing range extension or operation from device-to-device in areas of no coverage to mixed mode (using device-to-device and device-to-infrastructure) in fringe coverage areas. \r\n  \u2022  Support multiple open-standards (e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) mesh, LTE (3rd Generation Partnership Project standard including High Power UE)), 5G, Project 25 (P25), Digital Mobile Radio, Tetra).\r\n  \u2022  Consider availability, supportability, scalability, and sustainability of source components. \r\n  \u2022  Enable future-proofing and transitional technologies.\r\n  \u2022  Be capable of upgrading via software (new capabilities, standards, or use cases of technologies).\r\n  \u2022  Improve on the size, weight, and portability compared to existing communication devices.\r\n\r\nThe required proposed solution objectives include:\r\n  \u2022  Wide band transceivers to cover a range of 150MHz-6GHz (Spectrum flexibility).\r\n  \u2022  Operate with high power (variable with up to 3Watts desired optionally up to 6 watts at very high frequency (VHF)).\r\n  \u2022  Hardware abstraction (potential for future proofing loading by loading in any standard software-based communications standards to use the hardware platform). \r\n  \u2022  Design and approach shall meet Federal Encryption Standards (AES 256 and FIPS compliance).\r\n  \u2022  Battery capable of no less than 12 hours of continuous operations.\r\n  \u2022  A ruggedized design to support field operations to include durability for abrasions, rainy environments, intrinsically safe, protection from five-foot drop, and exposure to extreme heat or cold (120 degrees F to minus 16 degrees F).\r\n  \u2022  Lower cost is highly desired (ideal target costs should be less than $3k).\r\n\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2477005","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Video Analysis of Drug and Human Smuggling Activities","branch":"Science and Technology Directorate","topic_number":"DHS241-005","topic_description":"Within the United States Coast Guard (USCG), operators manually monitor shore-based video cameras to identify activities of interest or anomalous activities.

These systems are sensitive and provide some indication of the direction from the detector to the threat but can't positively locate that threat. Law enforcement personnel have to leave their vehicles carrying hand-portable systems to search for and locate the source of the radiation with only a general idea of where to look. Operators need a system that provides real-time three-dimensional mapping with R/N source localization and attribution in a compact mobile unit that can be used for monitoring along challenging pathways such as urban environments and between obstacles found in ports of entry.\r\n\r\nCWMD has worked with the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab to demonstrate the integration of Lidar and real-time video with a specialized mobile radiation detection system. The result was a customized solution that used Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to provide object detection and tracking, coupled with localization and attribution of R/N threats to a particular object in the scene, such as a vehicle or person. The system was highly dependent on the complex, specialized radiation detection system; it could not readily be transferred to another vehicle. If the vehicle breaks down or is involved in an accident, the integrated detection system it\u2019s carrying is unusable until the vehicle can be repaired.\r\n\r\nThis topic seeks innovative approaches to providing threat detection and localization through integration of contextual sensors with modular, commercially available mobile radiation detection systems. Offerors will use the detector in development of their contextual sensor integration system. The resulting system shall be capable of being quickly installed and readily shifted from one vehicle to another, as described below.\r\n\r\nSystem characteristics and requirements:\r\n  \u2022  The system should consist of components that operators can install in an unmodified sport utility vehicle (SUV) in less than one hour.

This is largely due to the plant operators inability to control critical manufacturing parameters such as cooling water temperature, nitramine concentration, and solvent/antisolvent ratios. To further exacerbate the problem, munitions\u2019 energetics manufacturing processes are poorly understood \u2018black boxes,\u2019 so the reason behind any deviation from spec is difficult to ascertain. We believe that by deploying a number of different measurement probes during various manufacturing steps, and analyzing the data via machine learning, we can dramatically reduce or even eliminate out of spec batches. The probes will collect data in real time as materials are manufactured, and the machine learning algorithms will provide nearly instantaneous recommendations to the plant operators on how to adjust their processes to target the desired properties. Beyond reducing out of spec batches, we would also like to reduce cost, environmental footprint (by mainly increasing energy efficiency and reducing solvent use), and increase throughput from existing lines. We believe in the long run, the insights gained for this program will enable easier transition of novel energetic formulations. \u202f \r\nThe purpose of this topic is to explore probe technology and machine learning algorithms that will be examined from the offerors and will be down selected based on time resolution, ruggedness, data output, safety, and suitability.\r\nThere are two key steps for this technology to be successful. The first is the development and deployment of novel probes that produce large amounts of data in real time. The second is an advanced machine learning system that can take the probe readings and provide adjustments in real time during manufacturing to produce the desired product.\r\nPHASE I:  Demonstrate proposed probe technology can produce the data required over the course of several manufacturing runs. The Phase I Base amount must not exceed $100,000 for a 6-month period of performance. \r\nPHASE II:\u202f Implement the probes during the manufacturing process and collect data.

These include assessing purity, particle size, and thermal stability. This analysis can compared against the predictions of the machine learning algorithms and the measurements provided by the probes. We will also test the machine learning predictions against the predictions of crystallization modeling software, when appropriate.\r\n\u202f \r\nKEYWORDS: \u202f\u202f Probe; Algorithms; Machine Learning; Manufacturing process; Energetic materials; Energy\r\n\u202f \r\nREFERENCES:\u202f \r\n1.\thttp://site.iugaza.edu.ps/ajubeh/files/2012/05/B00k-Mechanics-of-Materials-Mcgraw-2012-Ed6-978-0-07-338028-5.pdf\r\n\r\n2.\thttps://books.google.com/books/about/Particle_Size_Measurements.html?id=lLx4GzA-7AUC\r\n\r\n3.\thttps://books.google.com/books/about/Chemical_Reactor_Modeling.html?id=mrP6RNajRs0C\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2414665","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Non-Hydrofluorocarbon-Based Fire Extinguishing","branch":"Army","topic_number":"A234-002","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) MODERNIZATION PRIORITY: General Warfighting Requirements\r\n  \r\nTECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Materials; Battlespace\r\n \r\nTOPIC OBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to explore potential opportunities surrounding a non-HFC based fire extinguishing agent or system.

HFC 134a is being phased out globally due to its high global warming potential (GWP), the automotive industry has switched over to HFO-1234yf which is flammable and not suitable for current military system designs.\r\nThe idea to design a non-refrigerant based cooling system directly supports the Army Climate Strategy. The HFC 134a phase down plan included in Section 103 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) calls for a phase down of the production and import of HFC\u2019s down to 15% of the current levels by 2036. \r\nRather than trying to adapt military air conditioning system designs to address the flammability of HFO-1234yf, this design strategy is to eliminate the refrigerant loop altogether.

It is incumbent on the vendor to provide proposed, iterative deliverables over the PoP (or sooner) to complete the identified solution. Vendors will interact with military diving experts prior to delivering physical solutions to combat divers. Potential solutions can iterate and the ability to test potential solutions with a military unit is available free of charge. Solutions will be evaluated in priority of critical, essential, and enhancing priorities. Access to military diving experts during the touchpoints for feedback is free of charge, and companies should include the estimated cost of travel (assume quarterly multi day trips to various dive training locations such as San Diego, Key West, Panama City, or Pensacola for set-up, iterative prototyping, final product delivery & testing) to these touchpoints in their budget. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the Phase II deliverable of a prototype for extended Soldier touch points, companies will provide deliverable and final reports detailing performance and associated deliverables, any iterative adjustments based on user feedback, and final product details. The final report should also include plans to adopt the solution onto a military network with associated security protocols and logical access points.\r\n\r\nPHASE III: \r\nThe objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives through the effort by improving the device and developing the technology to TRL 7 and document the final design.

This facility has several critical requirements, but key innovation is focused on construction materials and techniques that drive the overall cost of the structure significantly below Army costs of ~$16M. Additionally, the solution should be developed with efficiency in maintenance and operating costs over a period of 25 years. This solution is to be implemented in the harshest climates of US Army installations ranging from heavy snow and wind to high heat and humidity. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Army\u2019s Holistic Health and Fitness Program is missioned to resource 110 brigades across the Army by FY2030 with people, equipment, and facilities. Specifically to facilities, H2F has designed and budgeted for SPRCs for each brigade at 43,189 square feet. Unfortunately due to traditional construction costs and requirements from existing construction contracts, the facility as designed has an unfeasible cost of over $16 million. Without a different solution in construction materials/techniques, the program office will need to continue forward with a facility of less than half the size. This equates individuals within brigades using the SPRC 2-3 times per week to only having access once every 10 days.

Smaller RADIACs (radiation detectors) will decrease the weight burden of equipment on its users, reducing fatigue and improving maneuverability. The impact of this topic will be lighter and smaller equipment that the wearer may carry. The scale has potential to be throughout the Army and other commercial platforms.\r\nTOPIC DESCRIPTION: The innovative approach of this topic is the focus on SWAP (size, weight, and power) in addition to performance. Since the 1920\u2019s, Geiger-Muller tubes (GM tubes) have been the technology used in almost all military RADAICs.  The current systems, UDR-13, UDR-14, and UDR-15, all use GM-tubes.  While the GM tubes can offer the needed performance, they have major drawbacks that limit the reduction of SWAP. The GM tubes\u2019 low sensitivity per volume and relatively high-power consumption will severely limit any SWAP reduction.  If a new suitable technology is not matured and the JPD-S must use GM-tube technology, then the new JPD-S will be about the same size as the current 30-year-old UDR-13.  Evolving ground-breaking technology such as solid-state gamma dose rate sensors offers the potential to greatly reduce the SWAP, with an overall objective of reducing SWAP by half. \r\nThe potential end users of this technology may be the ground combat troops. Those RADIACs are deployed at one RADIAC per squad level (about 10 soldiers).  The soldiers will rely on the JPD-S to provide accurate information about the radiation levels throughout the operational environment from response to disasters such as the Army\u2019s response in Operation Tomodachi (the US support to Japan after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear power plant accident) to operations on the nuclear battlefield.  Soldiers rely on their RADIACs to provide accurate information about the radiation level to help minimize and document exposures.\r\nPHASE I:\u202f Starting in FY23, Phase I would be multiple awards for 6-month efforts focused on scientific, technical, commercial merit and feasibility of proposed solutions.  If a performer proposed an existing detector, then the performer would need to demonstrate a clear path for temperature range and nuclear survivability.  If a performer proposed a new sensor material, then the performer would need to demonstrate that the new sensor material can accurately measure radiation.\r\nPHASE II: Starting in FY 24, Phase II would be at least two awards focused on development of the technology, integration into a detector, and testing. JPEO would consider the possibility of a Phase II enhancement depending on the progress made by the performers in Phase II.\r\nPHASE III and DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:\u202f In FY27, JPEO plans to start the program of record.

The intent is to improve the transition of R&D-funded technologies into the Army enterprise.   \r\n \r\nTOPIC DESCRIPTION: The Army research and development ecosystem does not have a simple, intuitive portal for Army research centers and acquisition offices to access information related to Army R&D investments, including technology capabilities, technology maturity level, milestone delivery schedules, etc. The lack of direct access to internal information and data limits internal Army awareness and analysis of potentially valuable technologies to support the Army enterprise. The result is a less robust use of R&D investments, missed collaborations and co-investments, and an overall decrease in the likelihood of critical technologies transitioning into the Army enterprise to support the Soldier. \r\n \r\nThe Army Tech Marketplace is envisioned as a web-based knowledge management and collaboration platform with an intuitive user-friendly interface that enhances transparency and simplifies access to R&D-funded technologies for Army stakeholders and private sector innovators to share, retrieve, and analyze information, and collaborate. The Army Tech Marketplace should provide an artificial intelligence and data-fusion capability to assess the probability of technologies to transition, identify trends within the Army enterprise, and maximize the value of business intelligence data to support agile Army decision-making.    \r\n \r\nThis effort seeks to create a platform for sharing information at the appropriate level first between different Army offices and second with members of the innovation economy. The effort will prioritize an internal Army-focused side connecting R&D needs and gaps with funding and resource opportunities. Internally, it must be a common, IL4 secure space for the Army and eventually, Joint Service research centers, acquisitions, and SBIR programs to learn of cross-organizational activities, mitigate R&D risks by learning from others, and dynamically exploit opportunities for collaboration. It will also have a generally accessible, external-to-the-Army side connecting innovation economy firms with Army technology challenges and the Army Program Executive Offices working to address those challenges. Externally, the Army Tech Marketplace permits Army, Joint Services, and innovation economy members to appropriately share information, build relationships, and facilitate collaboration, contracts, and integration of innovations into the Army enterprise.  \r\n \r\nIntegral to the platform must be data analytics and artificial intelligence enabled tools to assist internal Army Tech Marketplace users to assess technologies and trends to improve interactions with external members, as well as leverage the total value of the data on the platform to improve Army Tech Marketplace operations. These capabilities should be accessed through a simple graphical intuitive user interface that can serve users of various proficiencies and knowledge.  The platform should be vetted from both a software and usability standpoint. \r\n \r\nThe following are the generalized steps required of the company performing this work to frame and inform their proof-of-concept deliverable: \r\n \r\n1.\tWork with Army SBIR Program to align project goals, requirements, and roles. \r\n2.\tEngage key stakeholders identified by Army SBIR Program to conduct problem framing and stakeholder mapping activities to engage, discover questions, clarify language, and develop instruments useful to the stakeholders. \r\n3.\tReview and present findings on similar products and services that other military Services and private organizations use that may have similar or overlapping use cases. \r\n4.\tCollaborate with Army SBIR Program to identify and outline a detailed project plan, timeline, goals, scoping, and discovery outline intended to form the basis of anticipated Phase 2 work. \r\n \r\nThe following are success criteria for this effort: \r\n \r\n1.\tInternal Army and External Innovation Economy: Separation within the platform of internal Army stakeholder site from external emerging technology accessible site. The internal, Army-only site must achieve DOD IL-4 to handle Army data up to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The external, innovative economy-oriented side of the platform should achieve DOD IL 2 (Public or Non-Critical Mission Information). \r\n2.\tCollaboration: Enable collaboration across multiple Army users and private sector innovation economy firms. \r\n3.\tEase of Use: An intuitive interface informed by a human-centered design approach that results in a layout and graphics requiring minimal familiarization for basic portal navigation. Must be easy to customize fields to provide flexibility and offer a simplified Search Engine. \r\n4.\tWorkflow: Process tracking, routing, reminders, and ability to assign follow-on tasks. \r\n5.\tPlatform Modularity: Build a modular platform capable of easy expansion in both scale of participants and the scope of capabilities. \r\n6.\tReporting & Accountability: The ability to easily retrieve data and insights and track progress on pre-determined metrics. Includes but not limited to reporting and dashboards or other business intelligence tools to help visualize the data. \r\n7.\tAnalytics: Offer data analytics and artificial intelligence enabled tools for trend analysis, customer discovery, and continuous improvement actions across the platform. \r\n8.\tLifecycle Cost: Respecting the platform\u2019s modular approach, create a total lifecycle cost model to account for implementation, training, and ongoing licensing/support costs. \r\n \r\nPHASE I: Starting in FY23, Phase I would be for multiple awards of $200,000 each with a 4-month period focused on technical value, commercial merit, and feasibility of proposed solutions. At a minimum, the deliverable from Phase I would be a detailed technical presentation on the design and attributes of the proposed platform conforming to the eight success criteria listed in the Topic Description. \r\n \r\nPHASE II: In FY 23, an award would be made to refine the plan developed in Phase I and create a minimum viable platform for testing and evaluation by the Army Applied SBIR Program and its stakeholders employing the eight success criteria listed in this Topic Description. These criteria are subject to revision based on the results of the outcome of the Phase I effort.  \r\n \r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  The proposed technology has potential use within the Army Small Business Innovation Research Program as well as other Army Research Centers and acquisition programs. \r\n\u202f \r\nKEYWORDS: R&D; research and development; portal; Webpage integration; knowledge management; collaboration platform; innovation economy; tech marketplace; software; website\r\n\u202f \r\nREFERENCES:\u202f \r\nhttps://www.armysbir.army.mil/topics/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ausa.org/sites/default/files/SR-1990-A-Primer-on-Research-and-Development-in-the-US-Army.pdf\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2414677","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Casualty Care Training- Mixed Reality Manikin Solution for Female Soldier Survivability","branch":"Army","topic_number":"A234-009","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Combat Casualty Care; Human-Machine Interfaces\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nDevelop, demonstrate, and deliver solutions for enhanced female combat trauma mixed reality (MR) training manikin that incorporates open architecture utilizing high fidelity simulations for combat-trauma-related scenarios. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\nA study of the Army\u2019s medical training literature found significant disregard for the anatomical and physiological differences between males and females resulting in lower survivability rates for female casualties in comparison to males: 35.9% vs 17% and 14.5% vs 12% (Operation Iraqi Freedom) (Cross, Johnson, Wenke, Bosse, & Ficke, 2011). The Army currently trains Soldiers using male manikins when teaching Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC). The Army is looking to invest in technology that improves training to better care for Soldiers, specifically female Soldiers, on the battlefield and save lives at point of injury. Training using realistic, female anatomy can help reduce hesitation to provide treatment of battlefield injuries and reduce female deaths.\r\n\r\nThe Army is seeking a solution for a hybrid training tool utilizing a combination of augmented reality, virtual reality, and physical manikins to address female combat casualty care. To build out the best-in-breed training solution, all components need to be open architecture with plug-and-play capabilities to develop modular training independent of gender or scenario. \r\n\r\nWhile medical training is extremely hands-on, and the ability to physically feel what is happening is critical in training, virtual training provides ease and modularity for creating different training scenarios and reduces the cost of training. Currently, trauma medical training is done in either virtual or physical training environments. There are limitations for both approaches but combining the two will increase training effectiveness and reduce costs overall.\r\n\r\nCurrent Army medical training is male-centric with significant gaps in female trauma care (Bell, Thomson, Mazzeo, & Pike, 2020). According to the Department of Defense Personnel and Readiness Report of 2019, 14.9% of the United States Army population is female (2019, p. 93). This effort will not only move the needle to address female needs on the battlefield for the military, but it will also have applications in the civilian sector, better preparing medical professionals for trauma cases.\r\n\r\nPHASE I:\r\nDesign a proof-of-concept solution for an end-to-end system, or components of a system that effectively trains Soldiers utilizing an anatomically correct physical female manikin, physical task trainers, software simulators/trainers, and provides Soldier training feedback. Solutions will be evaluated based on a holistic view of factors including the ability to integrate designated Army open standards, cost of development, adaptability of solution based on individual Soldiers\u2019 needs or scenarios, and any additional factors proposed. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed effort, and to determine the quality of performance of the awarded companies prior to providing further support in Phase II. Final deliverable will be a concept design presentation, proof of technology demonstration, and plans for follow-on Phase II work. \r\n\r\nCompanies can voluntarily participate in the Army Applications Laboratory (AAL) 12-week cohort program. The AAL cohort program is designed to solve specific Army modernization challenges on a compressed timeline. The cohort program matches qualified companies with Army problem owners to speed capability development, accelerate transition, and de-risk or inform requirements. This program is designed for businesses that own unique, applicable technology and are interested in growing a new line of business through the DoD.\r\n\r\nThe cohort program will enhance technology development through rapid exposure to Army stakeholders and the Army medical simulation community. Planned activities include a problem topic deep dive, a field week with Army leaders and Soldiers, hands-on experience with currently fielded military equipment, and stakeholder engagement from the requirements writer, to the acquisition manager, to the end-user. An example cohort program for this topic is: \r\n\r\nWeek 1 \u2013 Orientation and problem deep-dive (virtual) \r\nWeek 2 \u2013 Soldier Touchpoint (in-person at an Army installation)\r\nWeek 3-6 \u2013 Concept research and planning\r\n  Week 7 \u2013 Mid-point concept design brief to Army Senior Leaders and SME roundtable discussion    (in-person at an Army installation)\r\n  Week 8-11 \u2013 Concept design refinement\r\n  Week 12 \u2013 Final concept design brief to Army Senior Leaders (in-person at an Army installation)\r\n\r\nCohort programming will be provided free of charge. Proposers who plan to participate in the cohort (if awarded a Phase I) are encouraged to include travel costs for three cohort trips, within the continental US, for four to five days each for in-person programming. In-person events may be substituted for virtual events depending on COVID-19 travel restrictions. Details will be provided to awardees under this topic at Phase I award.\r\n\r\nPHASE II:\r\nDesign a prototype demonstration for the continued development efforts initiated in Phase I. Prototypes should be capable of integration with existing Army systems or newly developed systems from other awardees. They should also showcase modularity and prove effective during simulated or operational demonstrations. \r\n\r\nPhase II deliverables include a demonstration and delivery of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 prototype for further Army evaluation, as well as quarterly and final reports detailing design and performance analysis of the prototype.\r\n\r\nAwardees may also be eligible for Phase IIb award after completion of Phase II period of performance. Phase IIb can extend the period of performance with additional funding and additional matching opportunities to finish building out solutions with the stakeholders\u2019 discretion.\r\n\r\nPHASE III:\r\nThe objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives through the effort. Companies may develop a manufacturing-ready product design, capable of integration with the existing or future system, and demonstrate technology integration. Low-rate production will occur as required. Companies will engage in laboratory or operational testing as required. Phase III deliverables include system-level integration technical data package, installation documentation, and system-level prototype for demonstration and government-sponsored testing\r\n\r\nWEBINAR DATE:\r\nTwo Webinars will be conducted with this solicitation on Tuesday, 21 March: Webinar 1 (1500-1600 CST) and Thursday, 23 March: Webinar 2 (1200-1300 CST).

This fact creates a \u201ctyranny of distance,\u201d meaning that, distance lessens military strength and increases the cost of conflicts. The impact of long distances can affect overall strategy, tactics, and logistics. Even with unrivaled capabilities, the ability to collect and understand intelligence can decay over distance. The supply chain is also heavily impacted, as distance increases, the time to provide supplies increases, supply routes can be contested, and even when supplies arrive safely, upkeep and maintenance are still a concern. These are just a few of the ways that distance impacts the effectiveness of our military overseas.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Army is interested in enabling technologies that could help overcome the \u201ctyranny of distance\u201d.

While batteries have made great strides in recent decades, they remain heavy and cumbersome. A potential solution for heavy vehicles is hydrogen fuel cells. Fuel cells can provide the benefits of electrification (silent mobility, silent watch, export power, high torque on demand, etc.) while maintaining current vehicle range and allowing for refueling in the same amount of time as liquid fuels. One drawback of hydrogen fuel cells is storage of the hydrogen itself. Current solutions are bulky composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) that take up significant space. A potential solution is conformable tanks that can be designed to fit unusually shaped space claims, allowing for more energy to be stored in containers, on vehicles, or in other energy storage use cases. This technology has been developed and validated to 350 bar (5,000 psi) applications, but further work is required to meet the goal of 700 bar operating pressures. Evaluation of these tanks under military ballistic testing also revealed some potential areas of improvement for this technology. It is important to develop this technology as it will enable high energy density storage that can be refilled as quickly as current liquid fuels while enabling electrification technologies and reducing thermal and acoustic footprints for energy generation systems. \r\n\r\nNote: This technology uses emerging manufacturing techniques along with a unique design that \r\nallows for the hydrogen storage tank to fit the shape of any space claim, utilizing a higher percentage of empty space than the current state of the art. The materials used are also lower cost and have been optimized to meet the demanding requirements for vehicle use.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II topic. To justify a Direct to Phase 2, the company should provide data showing a tank system made up of multiple segments (more than one) capable of 350 bar operations. At minimum, there should be data demonstrating the system can comply with proof testing and burst testing outlined in CSA/ANSI HGV 2.\r\n\r\nDIRECT TO PHASE II: Design a 700-bar system for vehicle use that qualifies applicable to HGV 2 standards identified by both TPOC and contractor. Demonstrate the performance of the system on an applicable vehicle system. Potential Phase II Sequential and Enhancement: Scale up the design of the 700-bar system for larger storage quantities. Undergo ballistic testing of the system with military specific ballistic threats. Incorporate lessons learned from previous testing and develop 700 bar systems for specific military vehicle applications.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is a multitude of industries that would benefit from improved hydrogen storage, with new use cases, like P2G tech, that will rely on hydrogen storage technology for operation. Efficient hydrogen storage will become a necessity as various industries, including transportation, metal refining, and chemical manufacturing, increase their hydrogen usage. The proposed technology has potential use within the Army Small Business Innovation Research Program as well as other Army Research Centers and acquisition programs. \r\n\u202f \r\nKEYWORDS: Hydrogen; Storage; fuel; battlespace; tank; refuel point; electrification\r\n\u202f \r\nREFERENCES:\u202f \r\n1.\tLithium Ion Battery, Clean Energy Institute, https://www.cei.washington.edu/education/science\u2010of\u2010solar/battery\u2010technology/\r\n2.\tPhysical Hydrogen Storage, https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/physical\u2010hydrogen\u2010storage \r\n3.\tConformable Hydrogen Pressure Vessel, https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1459184\r\n4.\tInnovative pressurized hydrogen storage for integrated vehicle structures using composites, \r\n5.\thttps://www.compositesworld.com/news/innovative\u2010pressurized\u2010hydrogen\u2010storage\u2010for\u2010integrated\u2010vehicle\u2010structures\u2010using\u2010composites \r\n6.\tMaterials challenges to enable hydrogen deployment at scale by 2050, https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCYQw7AJahcKEwjg37GFo_f7AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.royce.ac.uk%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F06%2FRoyce\u2010Hydrogen\u2010Conformable\u2010Tanks-Summary.pdf&psig=AOvVaw1WyXFqJZkfpV3vNpk4zMmc&ust=1671044241186277\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2414683","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Hydrogen Generator","branch":"Army","topic_number":"A234-012","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Renewable Energy Generation and Storage; Biotechnology\r\nTOPIC OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this topic is to develop an on-demand hydrogen generation system that can be used to quickly refuel a vehicle in situations where its main fuel tank is empty. The end user for this system would be fuel cell system operators. In the event a fuel cell system depletes the main fuel tank and battery power (assuming a hybrid fuel cell/battery electric architecture), this system can be used to provide hydrogen to the fuel tank (or directly to the fuel cell) to allow the system to provide power and return to safety. The system would be sized to be portable while providing enough energy to travel back to base, similar to how jerrycans are currently used.\r\nTOPIC DESCRIPTION: As the Army moves towards more electrified platforms, new challenges arise, such as running out of fuel or energy while executing a mission. Current vehicles can be refueled quickly from a jerrycan, allowing them to travel to the refueling point. Fully electrified platforms are not as easily refueled on the side of the road, which puts both Soldiers and materiel in danger. As the Army explores electrification technologies, preparing for situations such as this are important to keep both Soldiers safe and protect next generation platforms. Hydrogen fuel cells are a potential electrification technology that can provide near-silent power and mobility for military vehicles while providing high torque with inherently scalable power and energy, capable of providing range beyond that of purely battery-powered electric vehicles. Hydrogen can also be refueled more quickly than batteries can charge, providing an opportunity to solve the problem of a fuel-depleted vehicle on a mission. Several technologies exist that can provide hydrogen on-demand from solid materials that can be easily and safely transported and stored. One such technology of interest is aluminum alloys that react with water to provide hydrogen.\r\n\r\nNote: Hydrogen generators that utilize aluminum alloy and water are like an extra fuel tank, but\r\nless volatile. Aluminum powder can be safely handled and stored as a solid material, unlike liquid fuel. Several recent advances in the technology allow for the material to be manufactured at scale from scrap aluminum, providing a large source of energy in an inexpensive manner (1, 2). Compared to domestically sourcing lithium for battery production (and in order to meet future energy needs), this technology provides significant energy density without requiring rare earth metals, while at the same time needing significantly less infrastructure be developed. When exposed to water, the alloys produce hydrogen rapidly and at pressure, allowing a vehicle to be fueled quickly while providing enough energy to travel back to safety or a refueling point. The system can be designed with safety at the forefront, incorporating pressure relief devices and intrinsically safe controls.\r\nPHASE I: It is important to note that this is a Direct to Phase II topic. To justify a Direct to Phase 2, This Direct to Phase 2 effort should have data demonstrating the operation of an aluminum-water hydrogen generation system. The data should show the flow rate of hydrogen from the system, pressure during operation, temperature of the system, the amount of aluminum and water used, and control over the reaction (data showing a controlled stop/start cycle of the reaction). The proposal should also demonstrate the hydrogen from the reaction is pure enough to operate a fuel cell by either providing performance data from a fuel cell connected to the system or analysis of the hydrogen purity.\r\nPHASE II: Design a hydrogen generation system that can be man-portable while providing a meaningful range for vehicles in the case that fuel is depleted. Manage the thermal performance of the system, reducing both the exterior touch temperature to safe levels and overall thermal signature. Fabricate and demonstrate such a system. Demonstrate aluminum alloy production capable of supporting the manufacturing of several systems. Testing required for this technology would include measuring the flow rate of hydrogen from the system, demonstrating that the system can operate at the designated pressure, maintaining a safe external touch temperature, and effectively removing heat from the reaction.\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  There is high dual-use potential for hydrogen fuel cells, as users across industries continue to adopt this technology, especially in vehicles and industrial power. The high CAGR indicated rapid, significant projected growth across all sectors. Popular use cases for fuel cells in general include power generation for electric individual and mass transportation vehicles, industrial processes, data centers, and utilities, as well as residential heating. Hydrogen fuel cells can be used to build stacks, which can allow for modular power systems that can adapt to energy requirements based on the use case.The proposed technology has potential use within the Army Small Business Innovation Research Program as well as other Army Research Centers and acquisition programs. \r\n\u202f \r\nKEYWORDS: Hydrogen; Storage; fuel; battlespace; tank; refuel point; electrification; generator; generation system; power supply\r\n\u202f \r\nREFERENCES:\u202f \r\n1.\tUsing aluminum and water to make clean hydrogen fuel\u2014when and where it\u2019s needed, https://energy.mit.edu/news/using-aluminum-and-water-to-make-clean-hydrogen-fuel-when-and-where-its-needed/\r\n\r\n2.\tNanogalvanic Aluminum Powder For Hydrogen Generation, https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AlNanogalvanicPowder-Marketing-Sheet.pdf\r\n\r\n3.\tThe production of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier from aluminium waste, https://energsustainsoc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13705-017-0110-7\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2414685","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Dual Band Imager","branch":"Army","topic_number":"A234-013","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Sensing and Cyber\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The innovative approach of this topic is the focus on reduced SWAP (size, weight, and power) in addition to performance.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Missions require the use of multiple sensors in order to achieve specific objectives.  The sensors used extended range imaging applications relies on antiquated technology resulting in extreme sensitivity to Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP).

The capability should employ munitions (ammunition or explosives) that are currently in the U.S. inventory and attach to one or more sUAS platforms on the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) Blue UAS Cleared List, excluding the WingtraOne platform.\r\n \r\nDESCRIPTION:\r\nThe ability to employ lethal payloads on existing sUAS is vital for future Army combat operations. Lethal payloads for sUAS will provide capabilities at the small unit level beyond the current use of sUAS, which focuses only on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. Successful development of lethal payloads for sUAS would advance the U.S. Army\u2019s modernization priorities and increase the lethality of its Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs).  \r\n\r\nCurrently only one sUAS platform is fielded at the small unit level: the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) platform, fielded by Program Executive Office (PEO) Aviation and referred to commercially as the Skydio X2D. The SRR was developed to give infantry platoons a UAS platform for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Under the SRR program there is currently no capability to employ the system as a lethal asset.  \r\n\r\nThe Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), under the Blue UAS program, has worked with vendors to vet and scale commercial UAS technology for the Department of Defense (DoD). This program consists of five lines of effort that curate, maintain, and improve a roster of policy-approved commercial UAS which suit the diverse needs of DoD users. This effort currently has vetted 16 different platforms for DoD use.   \r\n\r\nGovernment labs are currently undertaking efforts to develop lethal UAS. These efforts include DEVCOM Armament Center\u2019s latest payload for the SRR platform, which delivers an M67 fragmentation grenade as the munition.\r\n\r\nThe design goals of this effort are the development of modular lethal payloads that can be employed by the current Program of Record SRR and/or any of the platforms on the DIU Blue UAS Cleared List excluding the WingtraOne platform.\r\n\r\nThese payloads should:\r\n\u2022\tBe attachable by Soldiers in the field\r\n\u2022\tEmploy ammunition or explosives currently in the Government inventory, allowing units to order through standard channels\r\n\u2022\tIncrease the lethal capability beyond that of the M67 fragmentation grenade-based solution currently in development\r\n\u2022\tIntegrate into the selected platform\r\n\u2022\tOperate on the platform controller or include a simple system to initiate the payload (long term desire is for ATEK integration)\r\n\u2022\tBe able to pass applicable safety testing\r\n\u2022\tBe able to be made safe and dismounted from the platform if not detonated\r\n\r\nPrimary obstacles to overcome for successful operation of lethal payloads for sUAS is the integration and control of the payload to the selected platform while maintaining safe flight of the platform.  \r\n \r\nCost should be considered in the SBIR proposals.\r\n\r\nPHASE I:\r\nDesign a preliminary lethal payload for the Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) platform or any sUAS platform from the DIU Blue UAS Cleared List, excluding the WingtraOne platform. Preliminary design should describe the selected sUAS platform(s) and munition(s), consist of a concept for physical attachment and electrical and software integration, and a description of the method of fire control.\r\n\r\nThis topic is accepting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described in above has been met and describes the potential commercial applications. Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results.\r\n\r\nPHASE II:\r\nRefine the preliminary design, produce, and deliver a prototype at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 of a lethal payload for a sUAS platform. The system refinement should include mechanical and electrical integration into the selected platform, fire control, and targeting. Required Phase II deliverables include all necessary components (hardware and software) to integrate the payload to the platform, attachment of munitions, safe handling procedures for munitions, arming munitions, targeting or aiming, delivery of munition, making system safe, returning to operator, and removal of munitions and payload to be utilized again if not employed. The prototype will be demonstrated using a simulated, dummy, or inert munition at a vendor-provided, government-approved location to evaluate performance.

Examples of technologies that address the issue include but are not limited to the following domains: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tNovel Materials for Additive Manufacturing \u2013 The U.S. Army is interested in enabling technologies that could replace conventional subtractive production methods. Novel feedstocks and 3D printable materials can be used to produce parts more with increased efficiency and superior performance. \r\n\u2022\tFuture Additive Production Capabilities \u2013 The U.S. Army is seeking novel and unique additive production technologies. These may include revolutionary production capabilities, or improved processes that can increase efficiency to reduce cost, waste, and production time.\r\n\u2022\tAdditive Production Systems & Analysis \u2013 The U.S. Army is interested in solutions to produce parts through additive manufacturing with improved efficiency, reliability, and quality. These technologies may include:\r\n\u2022\tManufacturing Equipment for Expeditionary Environments \u2013 The U.S. Army manufacturers parts in harsh environments including deserts, high altitude locations, and the Arctic. Such environments may be remote with limited logistical support, and may experience high humidity, dust, sand, and temperatures below -50C. Expeditionary production equipment must survive being stored in extreme environments and may also be required to operate in difficult conditions. \r\n\u2022\tAdvanced and Convergent Manufacturing Capabilities - The U.S. Army is also interested in novel non-additive production methods and hybrid/convergent manufacturing capabilities that combine additive and subtractive processes. \r\n\u2022\tAdvanced Materials \u2013 The U.S. Army is seeking research and development in the areas of novel advanced materials. There is particular interest in materials that exhibit improved strength, durability, and performance at both extremely low and high temperatures. A wide variety of applications for advanced materials include personnel protection, aerospace, avionics, and hypersonic systems.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Army would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTech Small Business Innovation Research Autonomy competition, an opportunity for eligible small businesses to engage and pitch their novel technology solutions directly to the Department of Defense, earn prize money and potentially receive a Phase I SBIR award of up to $250,000 each. \r\nThe Army recognizes that the DoD must enhance engagements with eligible small businesses, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of \u2018world-class\u2019 technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the DoD in the autonomy space; (2) integrating the sector of non-traditional innovators into the DoD Science and Technology (S&T) ecosystem; and (3) providing expertise and feedback to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the DoD.\r\n\r\nThe xTechSBIR Autonomy competition will consist of four-rounds: (1) Call for concept white papers; (2) Final Technology Pitch event; (3) Request for Phase I SBIR Proposal Submission; and (4) Request for Phase II SBIR Demonstration. The competition will be awarding up to $500,000 in cash prizes to select eligible entities throughout the competition. Ultimately, up to 20 winners will be selected from the technology pitch event round and will be invited to submit an application for a potential Phase I SBIR Proposal worth up to $250,000. Up to 20 companies will be selected to receive a Phase I SBIR award and then will be invited back after six months of award to conduct a live demonstration to a key panel of DoD experts. Details on the prize structure and phases, are listed in this announcement below. \r\n\r\nIn addition to non-dilutive cash prizes, participants will have the opportunity to engage with U.S. DoD and winners from the Part 1: Concept White Paper round will be invited to conduct an in-person pitch at Grace\u2019s Quarters in Maryland. \r\n\r\nThe efforts described in this notice are being pursued under the authorities of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4025 (formerly 2374a, Prizes for Advanced Technology Achievements) to award cash prizes as described in this announcement and potential SBIR contracts (15 U.S. Code \u00a7638) to only those eligible and selected entities as described in this announcement. In addition, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4003 (Prototype Projects) can be utilized to award additional follow-on contracts for additional proof-of-concept or prototype development. While the authority of this program is 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4025, the xTechSBIR Autonomy competition may generate interest by another U.S. Army, DoD or USG organization for a funding opportunity outside of this event. The interested organization may contact the participant to provide additional information which may or may not result in partnership opportunities. \r\n\r\nPHASE I: Companies will complete a feasibility study that demonstrates the firm\u2019s competitive technical advantage relative to other commercial products (if other products exist) and develop concept plans for how the company\u2019s technology can be applied to Army modernization priority areas. Studies should clearly detail and identify a firm\u2019s technology at both the individual component and system levels, provide supporting literature for technical feasibility, highlight existing performance data, showcase the technology\u2019s application opportunities to a broad base of customers outside the defense space, a market strategy for the commercial space, how the technology directly addresses the Army\u2019s modernization area as well as include a technology development roadmap to demonstrate scientific and engineering viability. \r\n\r\nAt the end of Phase I, the company will be required to provide a concept demonstration of their technology to demonstrate a high probability that continued design and development will result in a Phase II mature product. \r\n\r\nPHASE II: Produce prototype solutions that will be easy to operate by a Soldier.

Currently, there is not yet a cost-effective, adequate solution for this requirement. Practices such as traditional physical anti-tamper methods or warfighters having direct physical access to attempt platform destruction are not feasible for the new ecosystem of low-cost, high-count platforms. Conversely, digital erasure with its low barrier-to-entry, in terms of cost and implementation, is the suitable alternative.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Through reverse engineering techniques, adversaries can extract information stored in non-volatile memory from abandoned, misused, single-use, leave-behind, or unattended U.S. military systems. Furthermore, utilizing volatile memory storage (i.e., Random Access Memory, RAM) for a system\u2019s Critical Program Information (CPI), proprietary information, or intellectual property (IP) is not an adequate design technique to ensure the information is unrecoverable as new, sophisticated techniques are able to \u201cfreeze\u201d binary signatures etched onto the storage medium hardware. These capabilities enable adversaries and other nation-state actors to potentially modify, exploit, exfiltrate, or leverage U.S. military systems, including their design and information, risking Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) business advantages and the U.S. military\u2019s technological superiority. However, systems designed with reconfigurable logic hardware (e.g., Field Programmable Gate Arrays, FPGAs) instead of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to execute system functions provides a hardware fabric that can be completely erased in order to protect sensitive designs and information from being reverse engineered.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II topic (DP2). Small businesses, at the time of proposal, must have a solution capable of and, at the time of award, be able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept digital erasure solution capable of modifying the FPGA fabric to ensure the original data within memory is no longer recoverable.\r\n\r\nDIRECT TO PHASE II: As a Direct to Phase II, proposal submissions should include discussion on the following:\r\n\u2022\tDemonstrate digital erasure functionality on commercial platforms/systems/controllers that, once activated by a trigger mechanism, will successfully erase the FPGA fabric in order to prevent data recovery through reverse engineering of the memory hardware. \r\n\u2022\tCoordination with partners will reveal applications and preferred trigger mechanisms, thus the trigger functions themselves must be protected to mitigate the potential for adversaries to attack platforms through digitally erasing systems. \r\n\u2022\tThe developed tool will automatically implement digital erasure functionality onto FPGAs despite differences in vendors, components, interfaces, etc. to achieve platform-agnostic support.\r\n\u2022\tTo provide resiliency against reverse engineering, digital erasure function should erase FPGA fabric by writing randomized data to memory instead of writing only 0s or only 1s.\r\n\u2022\tOptimization steps to reduce total erasure/overwrite times and resource utilization will be identified and implemented during development. \r\n\u2022\tStreamline user experience and requirements both for warfighters to trigger digital erasure and for FPGA developers to implement digital erasure functionality. \r\n\u2022\tConduct commercialization strategy to integrate solution with existing toolchains and developer applications utilized by industry for FPGA development.\r\n\u2022\tSolution testing and evaluation will be conducted through FPGA developer tools to digitally verify that the memory has been successfully erased, and later through performing simulated data remanence attacks, where the hardware is manipulated to retain memory states which are then analyzed, to provide realistic verification whether the original data can be recovered through sophisticated reverse engineering techniques after a memory erase.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Data security is a top priority for organizations across all industries, which has companies rushing to adopt and implement the latest capabilities in data destruction and sanitation. The moderately high CAGR of 14.3% indicates sustained growth.

Existing capabilities to perform Scan-to-BIM in post-processing exist but cannot be applied to maps generated during fast-paced tactical operations. For this reason, DTRA is actively seeking the means to fund and integrate the proposed work.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II. The technologies to enable DEEP-BIM currently exist but have not yet been collectively applied to enable real-time Scan-to-BIM capabilities at the edge. Building information models of large facilities are currently able to be generated with commercial software using reasonable computer resources and little human correction. Object recognition using imaging and LiDAR exists to support these capabilities as well as a host of other applications.

This ability is vital for future Army combat operations. Successful advancement of Heavy-Lift Vertical Takeoff and Landing (HVTOL) Systems would enhance U.S. Army modernization priorities by increasing the amount of equipment that can be carried by a single platform at one time.

Tactical operational forces and sustainment forces prosecuting missions in contested environments, need the ability to improve understanding, synchronization, and situational awareness. This effort will expand and improve the ongoing efforts of the data-level tactical data platform which have established a number of use cases, benefits, and process flows. The topic team intends to leverage existing partnerships and experimentation to test, evaluate, and refine the concepts and usage over this effort as well.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This capability should fold into the ongoing PEO C3T Tactical Data Platform effort, adding technology for hybrid knowledge graph technology, richer knowledge-based representations, and facilitating more advanced decision support and reasoning capabilities utilizing AI/ML. This would be fielded as part of the C3T Tactical Data Platform across the full spectrum of tactical level operational and sustainment units, leveraging the computing infrastructure and communications channels already defined for the current Tactical Data Platform capabilities. The expectation is that companies can solve several problems with one solution; therefore, the request has identified five (5) areas of improvement: Automated Transformation of Data to Knowledge, Knowledge-Level Representation of the Tactical Situational Awareness with embedded meaning, Representing and Continuously Reasoning over Plans, Space, Time, and Entity State, Situational pattern recognition and model projection for automated detection of potentially impacting Patterns/events, and bridging Knowledge between Operations and Logistics to ensure synchronized and orchestrated awareness and unity of effort.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II topic (DP2). The commercial market for these knowledge-level automation and reasoning enhancements are at a high enough Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for this to be a Phase II topic. As part of the submission package, the proposing company will be required to include specific tangible examples of existing capabilities within each of the sub-areas they are proposing. The existing capabilities should be described with details of demonstrated capability, screenshots and references where available, and details of the companies, organizations, or events in which they were demonstrated. The company will be asked to demonstrate each of these capabilities in an Army tactical scenario or event that will occur 9 months into the Direct-to-Phase II award. The company submissions package will also need to provide specific evidence or demonstration of the technologies ability to operate in the constraints of a tactical environment, including intermittent communications, low-bandwidth, noisy data, and limited computational power.\r\n\r\n(DIRECT TO) PHASE II: As a Direct to Phase II proposal, proposal submission should include a roadmap of the expected deliverables:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t3MAC: Design and Model Review\r\n\t6MAC: Phase I validation of Key Technologies\r\n\t9MAC: Build 1 Demonstration of Base Knowledge-level capabilities\r\n\t12MAC: Build 2 Integration with current Tactical Data Platform\r\n\t15MAC: Build 3 Experimentation/First Evaluation Release\r\n\t18MAC: Build 4 Exp Revision / Ops-Log Sync\r\n\t22MAC: Build 5 Final Release / Second Evaluation Release\r\n\t24MAC: Final Report\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: There is high dual-use potential for automated data platforms.

Utilize new detector technology to lower manufacturing cost for SWIR sensors. A lower cost laser sensor would enable integration into platforms that support Soldier Lethality and Next Generation Combat Vehicles (NGCV). \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR) cameras with Asynchronous Laser Pulse Detection (ALPD) are an emerging technology. This has the potential to be used as a multi-function solution for various marking and detection tasks. The major barrier to the proliferation of current SWIR ALPD cameras is cost. At high price points, these SWIR ALPD cameras are unlikely to proliferate across the armed forces. A low-cost, next-generation laser detection sensor is needed. Current detectors use Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) focal plane arrays (FPA) that are meticulously bump bonded onto a Read Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC). This process requires both expensive materials and intensive labor, thus lowering yield and driving costs up. Previous efforts to lower the cost of this technology have proven unsuccessful. This SBIR effort aims to pair a low-cost detector material, such as quantum dots or other innovations, to a ROIC with laser detection capability. A novel approach to laser detection could have significant cost implications in production. This moderate-risk, high-payoff approach to a low-cost SWIR laser detector should produce a device that can detect laser pulses at operationally relevant ranges for marking tasks.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II (DP2) topic. A DP2 award is requested because of the demonstrations we have observed during lab and field evaluations of the candidate technology. The Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQD) material and process has been successfully applied to a standard ROIC and does have sensitivity in the SWIR spectrum to detect the laser spots. Awarding a phase II SBIR would allow for the development of the CQD process on a Read Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) designed for laser pulse detection, as well as optimizing the quantum dot sensitivity at the laser wavelength. Much of the potential in this technology has been identified and we wish to expand its application to better fit our customers\u2019 needs.\r\n\r\n(DIRECT TO) PHASE II: Develop and demonstrate a 2D SWIR detector with asynchronous laser pulse detection. This device should use a detector material and process that has the potential to be significantly lower cost than existing solutions in production quantities. An imaging function is desired but not a requirement for this effort.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: This system could be used in a broad range of military applications where laser detection is necessary. Optimize system design for size, weight and power, to include ruggedization to survive in a military environment. Recent advances in methods for synthesis and surface functionalization of CQDs have driven the commercialization of display and lighting applications and provide promising developments in the related fields of lasing and IR sensors. Current market applications, including start-up usage, for quantum dot technology embedded into semiconductors include: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMultimedia technology provides more immersive and realistic experiences. \r\n\tSmartphone sensing recognition and augmented facial ID recognition.\u00a0 \r\n\tAugment solar panels energy collection capabilities, which can be leveraged for renewable energy as well as agriculture production.\u00a0 \r\n\tMedical usage, namely bio-imaging and modeling of protein structures as well as infrared sensing. \r\n\tQuantum computing research in the nascent and pivotal future sector.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Sensors; Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR); Lasers; Detection; Cameras; Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQD); Low Cost; Read Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC)\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tST\u2019s Quantum Dot Sensor set for volume Swir Imaging.

Likewise, the pixel pitch of the larger medium format displays is on the order of 15-80 microns, as opposed to 9-12 microns for the micro-displays.\u00a0 The larger scale of the medium format relieves the requirement for magnification by the eyepiece optics, and hence a lower cost system can result. The problem is in obtaining military-grade medium format display panels with sufficient pixel resolution, since the commercial market for medium formats is more focused on low-pixel resolutions devices such as the iWatch. Also, daylight readability is a requirement not currently met by commercial units.

Validate the new capabilities using a high-assurance separation kernel, Robot Operating System (ROS) test suite, RTK applications and a representative hardware platform under realistic concept of operations.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This topic seeks innovative technology and demonstration that showcases the feasibility, security and performance of running the RTK and ROS software library on a high-assurance separation kernel. Supported by the DARPA High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program, both seL4 and CertiKOS have made great leaps in terms of software capabilities and maturity. However, significant challenges exist to bridge the gap between research prototypes and adoption. It is critical to leverage such innovative techniques and tools and build assured systems based on appropriate techniques and tools applying sound security design and engineering principles. The ported RTK/ROS over a separation kernel should function and perform with added security and it should maintain the features of (1) cross-platform: new RTK capabilities can be leveraged by all RTK-enabled platforms; (2) cross-controller: any RTK-enabled platforms can be controlled by any RTK compatible controller; and (3) cross-effort: an effort delivers new capabilities to the RTK, which in turn is leveraged for new efforts. In addition to memory isolation, the ported RTK/ROS should be amenable to other security checks such as the concept of Monitor and Policy Enforcement, as applicable and needed in DoD use cases including Autonomy and Swarm.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop the technical approach, analyze trade-off options, and justify design choices. All design choices, including a representative hardware platform, should be made in agreement with the Government counterpart.

By adopting alternative methods of energy generation, manufacturers can reduce their carbon footprint and the operational costs that they currently have.\u00a0\r\n\tThe are countless opportunities to apply the use of the technologies that come out of this effort into a wide variety of industries.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Energy Storage; Clean Energy Generation; Clean Micro-Grid; Electric Transportation; Clean Industry Technology \r\n\r\nREFERENCES: \r\n\r\n\r\n\thttps://www.armysbir.army.mil/topics/; \r\n\thttps://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/about/2022_army_climate_strategy.pdf; \r\n\thttps://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/about/2022_Army_Climate_Strategy_Implementation_Plan_FY23-FY27.pdf;\r\n\thttps://www.army.mil/article/259086/u_s_army_awards_prizes_for_clean_tech_solutions_aligned_to_its_climate_strategy\r\n\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2464861","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Remote Breaching of Obstacles ","branch":"Army","topic_number":"A234-028","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human-Machine Interfaces, Directed Energy, Integrated Sensing and Cyber, Trusted AI and Autonomy\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe technology within this topic is restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130, which controls the export and import of defense-related material and services, including export of sensitive technical data, or the Export Administration Regulation (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774, which controls dual use items.

Mined wire obstacles consist of anti-vehicle and/or anti-personnel mines or other explosive hazards that may be surface-laid or buried, with trigger mechanisms to include pressure plate, magnetic, vibration, radar, and others. Mines and explosive hazards can be manually emplaced or scattered by quick-delivery mechanisms such as aircraft or artillery. Mined obstacles are often accompanied by concertina wire, anti-tank ditches, berms, and physical barriers such as \u201ctetrahedrons\u201d to slow vehicle and personnel movement. Obstacles are usually overwatched by enemy forces to engage friendly forces attempting to breach the obstacle.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Army\u2019s current breaching methods require Soldiers at the point of breach, introducing the possibility of catastrophic loss of personnel and equipment and creating a risk to mission accomplishment. To conduct a breaching operation, Soldiers must locate the obstacle and decide where to breach a lane through the obstacle. Then they use an explosive device such as a Mine Clearing Line Charge (MICLIC) or mechanical means such as a plow or flail to detonate mines or move them out of the breach lane. Soldiers then \u201cproof\u201d the lane to verify that the obstacle has been neutralized, often using a mine roller to detonate any remaining mines. Finally, they mark the breach lane to guide passage of friendly forces through the lane.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Army is seeking solutions for remote breaching to decrease risk by removing Soldiers from the point of breach. We are particularly seeking technologies that contribute to one or more tasks associated with breaching mine and wire obstacles, to include but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDetecting mines and other surface or subsurface explosive hazards and communicating or marking their locations\r\n\tDetecting physical obstacles such as wire, anti-tank ditches, berms, tetrahedrons, or other types of barriers\r\n\tNeutralizing mines, explosive hazards, and physical barriers through explosive, mechanical, kinetic, electromagnetic, directed energy, or other means\r\n\tVerifying (proofing) the breach lane to ensure the obstacle has been neutralized\r\n\tMarking the breach lane to guide safe passage of vehicular or personnel traffic\r\n\tCommand and control of the breaching operation\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSolutions should allow Soldiers to conduct breaching from a safe distance of approximately 1000 meters or more from the point of breach. This may include technologies that can be employed by air or ground uncrewed systems or launched from a safe distance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSolutions should be capable of integrating as part of a larger breaching concept and may be employed alongside other systems either fielded or in development, such as a remotely controlled Assault Breacher Vehicle or other technologies resulting from this solicitation. The Army is open to solutions in the form of modular mission payloads that integrate with existing or planned robotic platforms such as the Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV) or other ground or air platforms.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Army desires speed and flexibility in remote breaching methods. Solutions should be employable quickly in response to a hastily-employed enemy obstacle, such as air-delivered scatterable mines, or as part of a deliberate breaching operation against a larger, more complex obstacle. Ideally, solutions should be scalable for use against obstacles with greater depth.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is likely to be significant technology overlap with solutions that can be used for non-combat operations such as locating and clearing legacy minefields. However, the focus of this solicitation is on technologies for creating a breach lane in an enemy-emplaced obstacle in the context of a fast-paced, contested combat environment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I:\r\n\r\nDesign a proof-of-concept solution or component(s) of a solution for remote breaching of obstacles to remove Soldiers from the point of breach. Solutions may include technologies for detecting or neutralizing mines, explosive hazards, or barriers, verifying that the obstacle has been neutralized, marking the breach lane, controlling the breaching operation, or other components that contribute to a successful breaching operation. Proposals will be evaluated based on the contributions they can provide to the overall breaching effort and the likelihood of the technology providing an effective solution. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed effort, and to determine the quality of performance of the awarded companies prior to providing further support in Phase II. Final deliverable will be a concept design presentation, optional proof of technology demonstration, and plans for follow-on Phase II work.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCompanies selected for a Phase I award may voluntarily participate in the Army Applications Laboratory (AAL) 12-week cohort program. The AAL cohort program is designed to solve specific Army modernization challenges on a compressed timeline. The cohort program matches qualified companies with Army problem owners to speed capability development, accelerate transition, and de-risk or inform requirements. This program is designed for businesses that have unique, applicable technology and are interested in growing a new line of business through the DoD.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe cohort program will enhance technology development through rapid exposure to Army stakeholders and the Army maneuver support community. Planned activities include a problem topic deep dive, in-person exposure to current breaching techniques, and stakeholder engagement with requirements writers, acquisitions managers, and end users. An example cohort program for this topic is: \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWeek 1 (15 Jan 2024)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Orientation and problem deep-dive (in-person: Ft.

Details on the due date, content, and submission requirements of the Initial Phase II Proposal will be provided by the awarding SYSCOM either in the Phase I contract or by subsequent notification.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe scope of the Phase II effort will be specific to each project but is generally expected to develop a functional prototype to demonstrate the capability, develop transition plan including production and fielding approach (including updated logistics and safety consideration) and further commercialization (non-DoD). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDeliverables include all software, scripts, architecture models, system/software design artifacts, user and transition assessment documentation, and fleet experimentation (FLEX) reports. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is highly likely that the work, prototyping, test, simulation, and validation may become classified in Phase II (see Description for details). However, the proposal for Phase II will be UNCLASSIFIED.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Field capability and logistics support.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSBIR@Connect Spotlight: Meet NAVWAR\u2019s Program Offices.

Prompt and rapid post-exposure decontamination is critical to reduce the post-exposure effects of CWAs. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition, a practical decontamination product needs to satisfy a plethora of secondary requirements, which include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBeing simple to use in the field under harsh and likely confusing situations.\r\n\tBe light weight, compact, and easily stowed in a soldier\u2019s pack.\r\n\tBe fast acting and effective under a wide range of environmental conditions.\r\n\tMeet and satisfy Federal Drug Agency (FDA) requirements.\r\n\tMeet and satisfy major DoD logistical requirements, i.e., long shelf-life, ease of transportation, manufacturability, and cost-effectiveness.\r\n\tLast, but not least, in addition to removing the toxic agents from skin, the product should be able to detoxify these chemical agents, both while it is being applied on the skin and after its removal. Rapid agent detoxification and decontamination effectiveness are intricately linked because in-situ detoxification is an effective method of reducing agent concentration on the skin before the agent has time to diffuse into the sub-dermal region. Detoxification of the agent also attenuates or prevents secondary contamination of medical or other personnel, and of the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nChemical warfare agents (CWAs) are among the most lethal and sinister substances manufactured by man (1). They are designed to kill, maim, immobilize, or psychologically threaten enemy troops. \r\n\r\nCWAs can attack the skin which is not only the body\u2019s interface with the outside environment, but also the largest organ of the body, with a surface area of roughly 1.6 m\u00b2 for women and 1.8 m\u00b2 for men (6).\u00a0 Skin exposure to warfare agents is also a major problem during non- conventional war (5), or terrorist attack. Over the eons, a wide variety of materials in gas, liquid or solid form have been mobilized for this purpose. At present, CWAs of greatest concern in military operations are relatively low volatility organic liquids that attack the skin (vesicants) or attack the nervous system (nerve agents) (2-4).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHuman skin, the largest human organ, developed as a physical barrier to the environment (to keep things out) but also maintains the aqueous nature of the human body (to keep things in). Mammalian skin consists of three major layers: stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis. The stratum corneum, the thin outer layer of keratin-filled dead cells (corneocytes) bounded by densely crosslinked protein and embedded in crystalline lamellar lipids, represents the major barrier protecting the body from loss of internal components and entry of undesirable external materials. The stratum corneum, composed of keratinized dead cells that are continually being replaced, is the first major barrier to chemical agents. The layer underneath the stratum corneum, the epidermis, contains cells that differentiate from viable keratinocytes to corneocytes during their migration from the dermis to the stratum corneum. It also contains a large number of specialized cells. The dermis is the main component of living skin. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe purpose of decontamination is to reduce an initial amount of harmful material deposited on the surface of a person or object from the environment to a level that is low enough allow it to continue to safely function. It should be noted that permeability of the contaminant through the surface of the person or object is a complicating issue for any surface decontamination process. Contaminant permeability renders decontamination more difficult to perform, places time limitations on the window of opportunity for its performance. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe alternative to decontamination is discarding the object, which in the case of living beings, is not an option.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent skin decontamination methods rely heavily on \u201cwet\u201d decontamination practices, which include washing the body with water, or soap and water (Roul et al., 2017). Alternatively, rapid decontamination makes extensive use of \u201cdry\u201d decontamination, which is based on adsorptive properties of powders, such as activated carbon or Fuller\u2019s Earth (FE) (Roul et al., 2017).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nImproved personal decontamination methods/products should consider:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe effects on both intact skin and open wounds.\r\n\tImpacts on the subsequent wound healing process.\r\n\tAgent variable decontamination efficiency.\r\n\tPost-decontamination CWA detoxification capability. Rapid agent detoxification and decontamination effectiveness are intricately linked because in-situ detoxification is an effective method of reducing agent concentration on the skin before the agent has time to diffuse into the sub-dermal region. Post-decontamination detoxification of the contaminant(s)will also attenuate or prevent secondary contamination of medical or other personnel, and of the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is a clear need to develop an effective man-portable capability that will rapidly remove chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and other toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) of interest to the U.S. Department of Defense from human skin, both intact and wounded, under austere conditions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: A feasibility study to demonstrate the technical and commercial practicality of the concept to include an assessment of its technical readiness and potential applicability to military and commercial markets.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Businesses will produce practical and feasible prototype solutions that can operate in edge and austere environments. Companies will provide a technology transition and commercialization plan for Department of Defense and commercial markets. The DoD will evaluate each product in a realistic field environment and provide solutions to stakeholders for further evaluation. Based on Soldier field assessment, the DoD will request companies to update the previously delivered prototypes to meet final design configuration.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tR.K.

Such applications typically require computing power to perform the signal processing and a sensor array to send or receive signals. These requirements are tailored to the specific application and may cause significant impact to the overall resources available for operations. Given the ubiquity of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) compute, sensors, and sensor platforms, there are multiple applications that could benefit from utilizing commodity hardware in lieu of requiring application-specific technologies. Beamforming requires relative time synchronization between nodes within an array and the ability to establish range metrics between senders prior to being able to beamform to a specific receiver. Typically, arrays are custom built where such information is already known or can easily be calculated. However, the creation of an array from heterogeneous commodity hardware requires such calculations to be performed on-the-fly and repeatedly as there could be modifications to the array during signal emissions.  \r\nThis Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) topic is seeking technologies for achieving time synchronization and coherence from a cooperating set of commodity devices. Vibe performers will explore novel approaches and develop prototypes for establishing distributed frequency coherence between a set of commodity devices to be able to achieve beamforming to a known receiver. Vibe is interested in any hardware/software methods that can achieve beamforming while also minimizing customized hardware solutions, maintaining a small form factor, and leaving the hardware inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Performers will develop novel approaches for utilizing commodity hardware for achieving distributed coherence and beamforming. Vibe prototypes should be able to demonstrate the ability to establish and maintain time synchronization necessary for coherent beamforming of a given frequency and waveform to a receiver. This can range from audible acoustic, ultrasonic, GSM, LTE, Bluetooth, WiFi, or other frequencies and waveforms of commercial/military interest and value. This receiver will also be controlled by the performer, but must also utilize COTS technologies to validate the transmitted signal.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. Therefore, Phase I proposals will not be accepted or reviewed. Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed feasibility study or a basic prototype system; definition and characterization of properties desirable for both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian use; and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methodologies (competing approaches). This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have application to the core objective of achieving coherence between a cooperating set of commodity devices. Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above have been met and describe the potential military or commercial applications. DP2 documentation should include: \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, and risks/mitigations, assessments; \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers;\r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers; \r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data;\r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models;\r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases \r\n\r\nThis collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and ability in computer science, mathematics, physics, electrical engineering, and software engineering. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD BAA and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The goal of Vibe is to design and evaluate an array to achieve coherent signal transmission and beamforming utilizing commodity hardware. Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed prototype system. These activities should focus specifically on:\r\n1.\tEvaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives.\r\n2.\tDescribing in detail how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve DoD need(s) as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale and broader signals. \r\n3.\tIdentifying the proposed solution's clear transition path considering input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber. Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions.\r\n4.\tDescribing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or Governmental customers for the solution.  \r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a system demonstration using one or more compelling use case(s) consistent with commercial opportunities, DoD opportunities, and/or insertion into a DARPA program. The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results for the Phase II effort.  \r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute Research and Development (R&D) plan as described in their proposal. Proposers will also complete a commercialization plan that addresses relevant material costs and potential material/equipment suppliers. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase II Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) (in person or virtual, as needed) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation. \r\n\u2022\tMonths 3, 5, 7: Technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this will normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 9: Interim technical progress briefing (live system demo with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM (in-person or virtual as needed) detailing progress made (include quantitative assessment of capability developed to date), tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, planned activities, and technical plan for the remainder of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 12, 15, 18: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 3, 5, and 7), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 21/Final Phase II Deliverables: Final architecture demonstration with documented details, demonstrating the establishment of an array using commodity hardware with sufficient timing and ranging capabilities; demonstrating beamforming to a designated receiver, documented application programming interfaces; any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the end of phase commercialization plan).  \r\n\r\nProposers must demonstrate in their proposal the ability to apply for and obtain a Facility Clearance Letter (FCL) with secret safeguarding, or already possess an FCL with secret safeguarding by Phase III. Proposals must outline the proposer\u2019s security plan for conducting prototyping, software development and testing of DoD applications at the collateral secret level by Phase III. All proposals must be unclassified, but proposers may submit classified annexes with prior approval of the DARPA Information Innovation Office Program Security Officer (I2O PSO); for instructions on classified annex submittals, contact I2Osecurity@DARPA.mil. Security Classification Guides governing potential classified Vibe applications may be provided to authorized U.S. contractor proposers upon request.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed Vibe technologies. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program.  \r\n\r\nPrimary Vibe support will be to national efforts in both commercial and military applications for novel signal delivery and resilient communications. Such technology can be used for protecting transmitters, localizing specific receivers, and providing signal in non-traditional environments.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tK. Alemdar, D. Varshey, S.

Both network data, that captures network connections and packet flows, and host or endpoint data, that captures the use of applications and other activities on a machine, are necessary to build comprehensive cyber defenses.  \r\n\r\nThere are two categories of existing datasets. The first is anonymized data from networks with human users such as that provided by the Los Alamos National Laboratory [1]. The second is synthetic data generated and collected from a cyber exercise [2]. The data generated using each approach has significant problems that prevent its use in developing and testing machine learning algorithms.  \r\n\r\nOne strength of anonymized data is that none of the events are synthetic. The data represents the actual activity on the network from which it was collected. What anonymized data typically lacks, however, is any sense of ground truth. Anonymized data usually contains limited events, preventing more realistic enrichments and limiting the scope of detection algorithms that can be trained. Using anonymized data from a real network also raises the question of whether there was a malicious actor active when collecting the data, and as a result, there is malicious activity represented in the dataset. If there was a malicious actor, there is no reliable or practical way to identify the specific events that were produced by the actor\u2019s activity. As a result, such datasets are not suitable for training machine learning algorithms. Further, elements of anonymized datasets may not be consistent amongst each other since there may be correlations in the actual collected data that are not recognized and preserved by the anonymization process.  \r\n\r\nAlternatively, synthetic data can be easily and automatically annotated with ground truth (e.g., accurately identify and label benign and malicious events). However, to date, synthetic datasets lack the realism required to fully support development, training, and testing of machine learning algorithms. Synthetic datasets also typically contain unwanted artifacts that reduce or eliminate their value (e.g., artificial artifacts introduce biases when training machine learning algorithms).  \r\n\r\nThe existence of unified endpoint and network data is rare because of several issues. First, the anonymization of endpoint data and network data both present unique challenges. Notably, the limitless variations of potential endpoint data makes anonymizing it impossible for arbitrary use cases. Preserving correlations among data elements in both types of data is also incredibly challenging, and again impossible for generalized cases. Second, the collection of endpoint data for research purposes typically requires Institutional Review Board approval. Third, the configuration management of and policies governing the endpoints may prohibit the deployment of a collection agent. Finally, most commercial agents do not make collected endpoint telemetry available for local analysis, instead sending it for centralized (e.g., cloud) processing.  \r\n\r\nSUP will implement synthetic agents designed to generate user activity without creating spurious network or host artifacts. SUP will not create a self-hosted agent that generates activity and filters out its own events from the event stream. Rather, SUP will passively and remotely interpret data (e.g., from a computer screen) to understand the machine state, and then interact with the machine using external input sources (e.g., keyboard and mouse), thus emulating human users. All of the generation activity is \u201coff box\u201d so that no generational artifacts contaminate the collected data. This is a key factor in ensuring that the collected data is free of any spurious artifacts that may incorrectly bias machine learning algorithms generated from the synthetic data. \r\n\r\nThe \u201coff box\u201d synthetic agents implemented by SUP will be capable of scaling to at least five hundred (500) hosts within an enterprise test network. Additionally, SUP will provide for the ability to generate and record user activity and associated data without the addition of software on the subject hosts and without relying on remote logins to the subject hosts. Ideally, the lightweight \u201coff box\u201d synthetic agents will be built with a language that natively supports concurrency, enabling straightforward scaling well beyond the 500-host requirement.  \r\n\r\nSUP will be able to respond correctly and continue proper operation after unexpected pop-ups and other operating system notifications occur. This will be implemented without reliance on timeouts or waiting periods to avoid unknown dialogs; and SUP will not make any assumptions as to when dialogs may or may not appear.  \r\n\r\nSUP will continue to operate properly when the screen resolution changes unexpectedly (i.e., dependencies on image matching should work at any resolution without the need for code changes or a collection of images at every possible resolution).   \r\n\r\nWithin an enterprise environment, typically there are many different types of employees and departments that need to be protected, each of which may represent different types of user behavior, with communications closely matching organizational groups and software use differing as well. SUP will enable the emulation of multiple user profiles to provide a variety of realistic user behaviors across the environment. User modeling efforts may span multiple levels of complexity. For example, activities may be performed at random, quickly changing from web browsing tasks to e-mail. Alternatively, a specific workflow may be defined, providing scripts or playbooks from which to draw on actions. Finally, complex emergent behaviors may be built on models of real human behavior.   \r\n\r\nPrevious work has explored many approaches to user behavior modeling. Amirkhanyan et al. [3] looked at modeling user behavior using graphical methods called user behavior state graphs. Drawing on human factors research, Garg et al. [4] included features such as nervousness, typing speed, and mouse movement behaviors into user behavior patterns that could then be replicated in a testbed environment. Blythe et. al [5] explored using the Belief-Desire-Intention model for creating intelligent agents that were capable of using planning and reaction to achieve preset goals. These methods were demonstrated as part of the Deter Agents Simulating Human-Behavior module that is a part of DeterLab [6]. Additionally, the GHOSTS-SPECTRE project has also demonstrated use of machine learning methods to drive web browsing behavior in support of data generation while modeling changing user preferences [7]. Traditionally, user data generation has used an agent \u201con box.\u201d The agent creates artifacts as a result of its activity and those artifacts must be filtered out if possible; otherwise, they may introduce biases into any learned algorithm.  \r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed feasibility study or a basic prototype system; definition and characterization of properties desirable for both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian use; and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methodologies (competing approaches).  \r\nProposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above have been met and describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 documentation should include: \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, and risks/mitigations, and assessments; \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers;\r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers;\r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data;\r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models;\r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and,\r\n\u2022\tdocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed SUP solution can enable more realistic cyber training.  \r\n\r\nThis collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and ability in networking, computer science, mathematics, and software engineering. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD BAA and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The goal of SUP is to generate realistic synthetic data that is void of artifacts and capable of scaling. An average cyber operator should not be able to determine that the data is synthetic by looking at the generated data, even when the operator has knowledge of typical human activity that was modeled when generating the synthetic data. The operator\u2019s view of user behavior is limited to the event activity of the user; the operator will not have visibility of the actual content created by the user. The SUP prototype should easily scale as a result of its architecture and implementation language. \r\n\r\nDP2 proposals should present systems that: \r\n\u2022\tgenerate realistic synthetic data without artifacts such that an average operator cannot determine that the event data is synthetic; and  \r\n\u2022\tscale to at least five hundred (500) end user machines.  \r\n\u2022\tPhase II will culminate in a system demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program. The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II effort.  \r\n\r\nDeliverables must include: \r\n\u2022\ta software implementation of SUP for a virtualized test environment; and  \r\n\u2022\tan example dataset generated by SUP suitable for machine learning research.   \r\n\r\nThe Phase II Option period will further mature the technology for insertion into a larger DARPA Program, DoD/Intelligence Community (IC) Acquisition Program, another Federal agency; or commercialization into the private sector.\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation. \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this will normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (include quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24 (Final Phase II Deliverables): Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the ability to generate artifact-free data at scale; documented application programming interfaces; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the end-of-phase commercialization plan). Month 30 (Phase II Option period): Interim Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Interim report of prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies documenting key technical gaps towards productization.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 36 (Phase II Option period): Final Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final Phase II Option period report of prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics for scalability, assessments of realism, and costs, risks, and schedule for implementation of the full prototype capability into a government-chosen test facility.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: SUP has potential applicability across DoD, IC, U.S. Government (USG), and commercial entities. For DoD/IC/USG, SUP is extremely well-suited for large-scale cyber exercises, smaller-scale operator training, weapon system software testing, and automation of rote tasks. SUP has the same applicability as DoD/IC/USG for the commercial sector.  \r\n\r\nThe Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed SUP technologies. The proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in military or private sector markets. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program.  \r\nPrimary SUP support will be to national efforts to explore application of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve generation of realistic user events captured during cyber-security testing on synthetic ranges. AI technologies will provide the foundation for developing sophisticated user behavior models that can be used in cyber range exercises. In particular, it is important that these models are realistic and do not bias machine learning approaches because of predictable artifacts. Results of SUP are intended to improve the quality of cyber ranges used across academia, industry, and government\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tLos Alamos National Laboratory. \u201cAdvanced Research in Cyber Systems Data Sets.\u201d Triad National Security, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, https://csr.lanl.gov/data/.

The prototype should include fabrication of a metasurface aperture (sub tile) that can support wide angle, high-speed beamsteering, as well as any testing capabilities needed for capturing full antenna patterns from the prototype.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Providing persistent, global, space-based detection, tracking, and imaging requires high-capacity and low-cost sensors.  This cost is most acutely felt in the new low-cost \u201cproliferated\u201d space domain where space vehicle costs have been plummeting. The most suitable type of sensor for performance is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) due to its ability to provide fast, wide field of regard to detect, track, and image multiple moving objects of interest regardless of weather.  However, SARs are not cost effective to deploy aboard spacecraft in the numbers necessary to provide a persistent, global capability.  Another option could be lower-cost fixed mesh-reflectors or planar arrays as they are capable of generating adequate antenna gain, but they lack the ability to electronically steer a beam, and can only image one or two targets per pass.  Due to the lack of capability offered by fixed-beam systems and the prohibitive cost of using traditional SAR-equipped satellites for global coverage, DARPA is looking for cost-effective, fully-steerable track-while-scan radars that can be deployed in low earth orbit (LEO).  \r\nTo provide the cost-effective capability DARPA is looking for, metamaterial electronically scanned array (MESA) radars are of particular interest due to their ability to offer similar performance to traditional Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESAs), but at an order of magnitude less cost due to their simpler design.  While MESAs technology has been developed for both ground and air applications, it has not yet been developed for deployment to and usage in space environments.  \r\n\r\nTo detect and track objects over large areas (100s of square kilometers), the MESA would need to be constructed of coherent, digital tiles.  A super-array of digital tiles though would require new means to solve coherence and calibration challenges, while also burdened with the extreme temperature variations and high orbital velocities experienced in a space environment.  \r\n\r\nIn this effort, proposers will design and develop an operational electronically-steerable metamaterial antenna sub tile prototype, as well as:\r\n\u2022\tDesign and develop a near-field probe antenna test system to capture full antenna patters out of the antenna prototype\r\n\u2022\tDocument manufacturing development steps necessary for the metamaterial antenna\r\n\u2022\tDevelop all hardware and software to control drive electronics of active components of sub-tile to electronically steer a beam.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only.

In these platforms, system performance can be improved by increasing the radio frequency (RF) output power of the transmitter power amplifier (PA), which is directly proportional to the output power density of the PA transistor. However, the operating output power densities achieved in today\u2019s wide bandgap transistors are thermally limited to values substantially below theoretical electronic limits. The government has an interest in developing technologies to overcome these thermal limitations and realize robust, high-power density transistors that operate near their fundamental electronic limit of RF output power, with a focus on achieving high power density through reduction in transistor thermal resistance [1]. Success requires metrology that can accurately measure thermal resistance and interfacial thermal resistance of a variety of material and device structures. Furthermore, these measurements are required to verify that performer high-power transistors meet program metrics. \r\n\r\nExisting thermal metrology tools often use pump-probe laser-based techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and recent variants such as steady state thermoreflectance (SSTR)[2] . While these techniques are useful for the measurement of thermal resistance in thin films and interfaces, they are are limited in spatial resolution [2,3], and cannot measure thermal resistance and thermal resistance gradients in submicron devices. The ability to measure thermal resistance beyond the surface film (i.e., in the buried channel layer of a heterojunction device) and also characterize at both nanoscale and microscale dimensions, is critical to the development of high power density devices. The purpose of this direct to Phase II (DP2) SBIR topic is to develop a super-resolution thermal metrology tool that enables accurate characterization of the thermal resistance of semiconductor materials, heterostructures and devices, particularly wide bandgap and ultra-wide bandgap materials and devices at nanometer length scale. The tool must be capable of measuring both epilayers and operating devices with a thermal resolution less than 0.25 oC, thermal precision of 1 oC, spatial resolution below 50 nm, accuracy above 90%, and reproducibility and repeatability less than 2%. Specific measurement capabilities include thermal resistance, thermal boundary resistance of interfaces, and temperature of an operating device and, in particular, buried channel layers. The device-scale measurements must characterize both the surface and cross-section of a multi-finger, submicron GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) and an ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN HEMT. In addition, a comprehensive validation plan should be provided.  For example, the plan should include device-relevant material structures, such as GaN transistor layers, that are compared to other thermal measurement techniques for verification of results. The plan may also incorporate National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards. The final Phase II base deliverable will be a laboratory demonstration of the thermal metrology tool, along with a plan for construction of tool and delivery to a U.S. government organization.  The Phase II option of this topic will address the development of this thermal metrology tool into an automated, turnkey system that will be delivered to a U.S. government laboratory. The deliverables of the Phase II option will include both the tool, calibration standards, and any necessary software for demonstrating material and device thermal characterization. Finally, on-site support will be required to ensure proper installation and operation at the U.S. government organization.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only.  This DP2 SBIR requires documentation of existing thermal metrology capabilities and a proposed plan with supporting analysis showing that achieving 50 nm spatial resolution with high precision and accuracy is feasible. The documentation must include measured data, including thermal resistance, from existing thermal metrology techniques demonstrating less than 2 \u00b5m spatial resolution and the ability to resolve interfaces beyond the surface film. In addition, validation data from the existing thermal metrology tool should be provided.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The proposed plan must describe the path towards a successful final DP2 SBIR deliverable which meets the requirements listed below. This DP2 SBIR will have an 18-month duration in which the super-resolution thermal metrology tool will be designed, developed, validated, and tested for performance goals. The requirements of the thermal metrology tool are: \r\n    \r\n1.\tCapable of measuring thermal resistance, thermal boundary resistance, and temperature of operating multi-finger, submicron GaN HEMT and ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN HEMT with the following specifications:   \r\na.\tSpatial resolution < 50 nm   \r\nb.\tThermal resolution < 0.25 oC  \r\nc.\tThermal precision: 1 oC  \r\nd.\tAccuracy > 90%   \r\ne.\tReproducibility and repeatability < 2% \r\n    \r\n2.\tTool validation using a comparison of measured results of device relevant structures to other thermal metrology techniques.  In addition, validation may use available NIST standards.    \r\n\r\nPhase II (base) fixed milestones include:   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Detailed report on super-resolution thermal metrology tool design, including documentation of path towards achieving in-situ device testing and meeting DP2 SBIR goals.   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Report on progress towards final design and demonstration of thermal metrology tool.   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Report on progress towards final design and demonstration of thermal metrology tool.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 9: Report on progress towards final design and demonstration of thermal metrology tool.   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Initial prototype demonstration of super-resolution thermal metrology tool.

The term wearable technology refers to small electronic and mobile devices, or computers with wireless communications capability that are incorporated into gadgets, accessories, or clothes, which can be worn on the human body [1]; for the purposes of this SBIR topic, it does not apply to invasive versions such as micro-chips or smart tattoos. Wearable technology can provide invaluable physiological and environmental data that can potentially be used to assess a warfighters\u2019 physical/mental wellness and readiness.     \r\n\r\nModern edge devices, like smartphones and smart watches, are equipped with an ever-increasing set of sensors, such as accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes, etc., that can continuously record users\u2019 movements and motion [2]. The observed patterns can be an effective tool for seamless Human Activity Recognition which is the process of identifying and labeling human activities by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) to sensor data generated by smart devices both in isolation and in combination [3, 4].     \r\n\r\nHowever, smartphone and wearable sensor signals are typically noisy and can lack context/causality due to inaccurate timestamps when the device sleeps, goes into low-power mode, or experiences high resource utilization. Thus, it can be challenging to fuse any of the various raw sensor data to achieve positive or negative assessment in wellness areas such as personal healthcare, injuries, fall detection, as well as monitoring functional/behavioral health. For instance, sensor data can be processed into feature data related to sleep or different physical activities that potentially correlate to effects on an individual\u2019s health [5, 6].    \r\n\r\nThe objective of WEAR is to develop a secure and lightweight framework for real-time analysis of sensory data from wearables to monitor warfighter health and readiness at the edge. Importantly, WEAR will achieve this goal while consuming less than 5% of the wearable battery over 10 days, assuming an initial full battery charge. The battery consumption metric is of particular interest to WEAR as warfighters at the edge (e.g., expeditionary forces deployed to remote locations or Special Operations Forces units) may not be able to recharge wearable batteries due to mission constraints limiting access to power sources for re-charging. Equally important is the need for all processing to occur at the edge because of security concerns [8]. Existing commercial efforts require cloud and off-premises server resources to analyze sensor data.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase 2 (DP2) proposals only. Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of framework properties/technology capabilities desirable for both Department of Defense (DoD)/government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).      Entities interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific/technical merit and feasibility described above has been achieved and also describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 Phase I feasibility documentation should include:     \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, risks/mitigations, and technology assessments;   \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers;  \r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers;  \r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data;  \r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models;  \r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and,  \r\n\u2022\tdocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed WEAR solution can enable accurate and reliable analysis of sensory data at the edge.      \r\n\r\nThis collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in AI/ML, data analytics, edge technologies, software development/engineering, and mobile security/privacy. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD Broad Agency Announcement and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The Personal Health Determinations (WEAR) SBIR topic seeks to develop a secure and lightweight framework that can perform real-time analysis of sensory data from wearables to monitor warfighter operational health and readiness at the edge, while consuming less than 5% of the wearable battery over 10 days, assuming an initial full battery charge (i.e., WEAR component overhead can be no more than 5% of the wearable battery over 10 days).    \r\n\r\nOne potential direction to achieve this goal is to leverage advances in low-power sensing at the chipset level present in modern mobile and wearable devices, including but not limited to \u201calways-on sensing.\u201d The primary interest is in commercial-off-the-shelf hardware paired with novel sensor drivers and algorithms developed to operate at low power. A secondary objective is to offer modular application programming interfaces (APIs) to access sensor data and edge ML models/algorithms that can fit into the resource-constrained environments of commercial wearables. The end goal is the capability to monitor and accurately assess warfighter operational health and readiness by using the sensory information on the edge devices without transporting information outside of the wearable or smartphone devices. Any custom hardware or sensors are out of scope for this solicitation.    \r\n\r\nDP2 proposals should:    \r\n\u2022\tdescribe a proposed framework design/architecture to achieve the above stated goals;  \r\n\u2022\tpresent a plan for maturation of the framework to a demonstrable prototype system; and  \r\n\u2022\tdetail a test plan, complete with proposed metrics and scope, for verification and validation of the prototype system performance.    \r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a prototype system demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program (e.g., Warfighter Analytics using Smartphones for Health (WASH [7]), which seeks to use data collected from cellphone sensors to enable novel algorithms that conduct passive, continuous, real-time assessment of the warfighter).     \r\n\r\nThe Phase II Option period will further mature the technology for insertion into a DoD/Intelligence Community (IC) Acquisition Program, another Federal agency; or commercialization into the private sector.    \r\n\r\nThe below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II and Phase II Option period efforts.    Schedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal, including the below:  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation.   \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the ability to perform real-time analysis of sensory data at the edge while consuming less than 5% of the wearable battery over 10 days; documented APIs; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the commercialization plan).   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 30 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 36 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics for battery consumption and assessment of monitoring/assessment capabilities to support determinations of warfighter health status.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III Dual use applications (Commercial DoD/Military): WEAR has potential applicability across DoD and commercial entities. For DoD, WEAR is extremely well-suited for continuous, low-cost, opportunistic monitoring of warfighter health in the field, where specialized equipment and medical experts are not necessarily available. WEAR has the same applicability for the commercial sector and has the potential to provide doctors and physicians with invaluable historical patient health data that can be correlated to their activities, environment, and physiological responses.      \r\n\r\nPhase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed WEAR technologies. The proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in military or private sector markets.      Primary WEAR support will be to national efforts to explore the ability to collect and fuse sensor data and apply ML algorithms at the edge to that data in a manner that does not drain device battery. Results of WEAR are intended to improve healthcare monitoring and assessment at the edge, across government and industry.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n[1] Aleksandr Ometov, Viktoriia Shubina, Lucie Klus, Justyna Skibinska, Salwa Saafi, Pavel Pascacio, Laura Flueratoru, Darwin Quezada Gaibor, Nadezhda Chukhno, Olga Chukhno, Asad Ali, Asma Channa, Ekaterina Svertoka, Waleed Bin Qaim, Ra\u00fal Casanova-Marqu\u00e9s, Sylvia Holcer, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Sospedra, Sven Casteleyn, Giuseppe Ruggeri, Giuseppe Araniti, Radim Burget, Jiri Hosek, Elena Simona Lohan,  A Survey on Wearable Technology: History, State-of-the-Art and Current Challenges, Computer Networks, Volume 193, 2021, 108074, ISSN 1389-1286, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108074.

From the earliest computer and the first FORTRAN compiler, we have perfected how to store and compute dense tensor data. However, a large portion of the data, either obtained from nature or generated by humans, is sparse. The Python programming environment is increasingly the tool of choice for scientific processing, but it has poor support for sparsity; current practice is to ignore the sparsity and treat the data as dense, incurring unnecessary overhead, or to transform the data into unnatural dense formats, making the programs much more complicated. Capitalizing on sparsity can greatly increase the efficiency of scientific computations, but the challenge is that there are a large number of sparse data formats, each of which takes advantage of particular features of the data; the algorithms that operate on these different data formats are then specialized to exploit the advantages of the specific data formats. An additional challenge is that there are a variety of hardware accelerators for matrix and tensor computations, ranging from features in conventional CPUs and GPUs to new hardware capabilities that have been developed to accelerate computations on sparse data. Dealing with this complexity is a challenge that is not within the reach of most programmers. The objective of this effort is to make the processing of sparse data as accessible and efficient as working with dense data. Specifically, to make the Python APIs for array processing (in NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, and scikit-learn used by 10s of millions of people) work seamlessly with sparse data.  ESPy will build on the current Python scientific library approach (e.g. NumPy and SciPy), to minimize source code changes and encourage community take-up, and add sparsity awareness and the ability to target multiple hardware architectures, including at least one architecture with features aimed at accelerating computation on sparse data. A framework or domain-specific language approach can be used to encapsulate the Python application, or the Python environment can be extended with an array/tensor algebra compiler; the selected approach should require minimal source-code changes. A compilation intermediate representation should be devised or adapted that incorporates sparse semantics, such as degree of sparsity and data formatting, and that can be efficiently targeted at multiple run-time hardware architectures. Data formatting transformations should be minimized.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. Selected performers will have an established and documented background and experience with most or all of the following: the design and implementation of Python-based libraries, frameworks, domain-specific-languages, compilers, compilation intermediate representations, code generation and optimization, and a range of target computer architectures including CPUs, GPUs, and hardware accelerators. Performers should also be able to document familiarity with sparse and dense tensor algebra, including comprehensive coverage of the many sparse and dense data structures and formats.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The goal of ESPy is to establish an efficient and easy-to-use sparse tensor algebra capability in the Python scientific ecosystem. The facility can be based on a library approach, or use a domain-specific language or a framework to facilitate the capability, as long as there are minimal code changes for the Python programmer. There are a multitude of sparse object data structures and formats, and ESPy should support as many of these as possible, and be capable of extension to additional sparse data formats as needed or required. ESPy should also support multiple target architectures including at least one architecture implementation with features that can be exploited to accelerate sparse vector or matrix processing. ESPy\u2019s support of tensor algebra shall be more than just addition and multiplication by providing a rich set of operators and functions, such as convolutions and semi-rings.

The topic is composed of two linked subtopics: Subtopic 1 will develop accelerator technology, and Subtopic 2 will focus on distributed system designs and pilot demonstrations. \r\n\r\nAccelerators developed as part of the first subtopic will be capable of generating continuous, high current electron beams at 2 to 10 MeV energies using 10 kW electric sources. 10 kW generators are commonly used in deployed support operations such as those found in containerized kitchens. Specifically, this subtopic will explore recent innovations resulting in accelerator designs that can be produced for tens of thousands of dollars compared to millions of dollars for traditional high power accelerators such as Rhodotrons and S-band LINACs, while being suitable for new distributed system architectures. High-gradient direct current (DC) accelerator structures, novel voltage multiplier designs, and new innovations in dielectric materials may provide viable technical approaches. Further, new solid state amplifiers could provide a potential path for radiofrequency (RF) approaches. Such configurations could present the highest potential for compact, low-cost, high wall-plug efficiency accelerator designs.  \r\n\r\nThe second subtopic, system studies, will initially focus on two use cases: (1) a single 10 kW system for deployed or austere environments and (2) multiple distributed 10 kW systems for point of packaging applications. Subtopic 2 performers will conduct detailed economic analysis including capital costs and operations and maintenance costs. The analysis will define minimum viable product and systems characteristics that can be economically produced  and address the maximum number of applications for wide-spread use while still achieving treatment and throughput requirements. Further, practical issues such as radiation shielding, automation, and regulatory concerns will be addressed. These analyses will be informed by strong food industry, U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) engagements. Systems work will culminate in a proof-of-concept pilot demonstration of the specific subtopic accelerator technology. Such a demonstration aims to establish broader adoption of food irradiation and enhance food safety and security for both deployed and domestic applications. In addition, secondary applications such as sterilization and remediation will be examined.\r\n\r\nIt is envisioned that between the two subtopics, technical, economic, and regulatory hurdles currently hindering food irradiation adoption will be fully addressed. This, in turn, will jumpstart commercial activity in this sector leading to viable products, new industrial development, and overall greater food safety and security.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. There is no Phase I; however, proposers must provide evidence of approach feasibility with results at a level commensurate with the conclusion of a Phase I effort. Examples of such evidence are included below for each subtopic.  \r\n\r\nProposers to Subtopic 1 are required to provide documentation outlining success in high efficiency accelerator component technologies. Achievements must be substantial. For example, a key component for a DC accelerator could be a Cockroft-Walton voltage ladder. Such a ladder showing 1 MV and an efficiency of >70% into a representative load would be considered sufficient.  \r\nProposers to Subtopic 2 are required to provide documentation outlining success in prior end-to-end system design, demonstration of hands-on work with analogous technologies (including core competencies with accelerator technologies), and experience working with regulatory agencies \u2013 specifically the FDA and state regulatory bodies for machine-produced radiation sources.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: SaFE is composed of two linked subtopics over an anticipated 3-year period of performance. The period of performance is divided into a 12-month base and two 12-month option periods. Proposers may apply to one or both subtopics.\r\n\r\nSubtopic 1: Accelerator technology development. The overall goal of Subtopic 1 is to produce and demonstrate a turn-key high efficiency, low cost, reasonably compact, irradiation accelerator prototype at technology readiness level 6 with the following characteristics:  \r\n\r\nParameter\tThreshold\tObjective\r\nTunable electron energy range (MeV)\t     2-5\t             2-10 \r\nMax x-ray energy (MeV)\t     5\t              7.5 \r\nWall plug efficiency (Pbeam/Pwall)\t  > 0.3\t            > 0.7\r\nUnit cost ($)\t< $100,000\t       < $50,000   \r\n\r\nThe accelerator must make use of 10 kW electric generator output such as 120V@100A or 208V@50A. The complete, turn-key system including controls, accelerator, RF generation (if appropriate), shielding, beam steering, and target must be compatible with a single 463L pallet. Additional suitability metrics include a removable x-ray converter (such as tantalum) to support x-ray production, continuous or near continuous operation, and targets compatible with conveyer-based operations.    \r\n\r\nThe 12-month base period will focus on accelerator design, modeling, and component development. The design will progress through typical processes including a system requirements review, preliminary design review, and a critical design review. Components will be developed and tested supporting the overall accelerator design.  \r\n\r\nBase period (12 month) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Kickoff materials. Slide deck summarizing technical approach to meet overall goals, risks, and risk mitigations and quantified milestone schedule  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: System Requirements Review   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Preliminary Design Review \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Critical Design Review  \r\n\r\nDuring the 12-month Option 1 period, components will be refined and integrated into a prototype system. This system will be tested to verify performance and ultimately used in Subtopic 2\u2019s pilot system demonstration.  \r\n\r\nOption 1 period (12 month) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Complete Accelerator Prototype \r\n\u2022\tMonth 9: Test and Eval of Prototype \r\n\u2022\tMonth 10: X-ray Target Assessment \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Integrated T&E of Prototype  \r\n\r\nDuring the 12-month Option 2 period, support will be provided to Subtopic 2\u2019s pilot system demonstration and the accelerator will be further refined to a minimum viable product using feedback from Subtopic 2.  \r\n\r\nOption 2 period (12 month) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Accelerator Integration Report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Final Accelerator and System Design  \r\n\r\nMonthly written technical progress reports will supplement the above milestones (see template under SBIR/STTR BAA DOCUMENTS at https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/for-small-businesses/participate-sbir-sttr-program).  \r\n\r\nSubtopic 1 performers are expected to collaborate with subtopic 2 performers in this program.  \r\n\r\nSubtopic 2: Irradiation system design and proof-of-concept pilot demonstration\r\n\r\nSubtopic 2 will complete system studies for two use cases using the accelerator technology of Subtopic 1. As mentioned above, the first use case will examine operation in deployed or austere environments. Food-based logistical support aims to feed 300 troops from mobilized trailers or 800 troops from containerized kitchens. About 32 lbs. of food supplies (including packaging) are needed per troop per week.  This is about 2 kg/day at an average density of ~0.5 g/cc. Detailed modeling and analysis will be carried out on various objects and package configurations, and optimization studies will be conducted to provide effective treatment per object at maximum throughput. In addition, Monte Carlo analysis will be used to study radiation shielding. Such shielding could make use of supplied or indigenous materials or combinations of both to minimize size and weight. Handling systems will also be developed and included in the design studies. Metrics for this use case are described in the table below.  \r\nParameter\tThreshold\tObjective\r\nSize and weight (463L pallets)\t< 2\t< 1\r\nThroughput (kg/hr)\t> 50\t> 180\r\nDose/item (kGy)\t> 0.4\t> 1\r\nDose uniformity ratio\t< 2.5\t< 1.4\r\n\r\nSize and weight metrics include the full accelerator of Subtopic 1. Object and packaging details as well as feedback on aspects of practical system suitability are anticipated through discussions with performer(s) and DoD stakeholders during the base period.   \r\n\r\nThe second system study will examine using the accelerator of Subtopic 1 in a distributed architecture at the point of packaging.  Perishable food such as lettuce or ground beef and associated packaging will be analyzed.  Detailed technical analysis, economic analysis, and commercialization plans for the system will be completed with the goal of minimizing overall system costs. The specific use case will be proposed by the performer. Metrics for this use case are described in the table below.\r\n\r\nParameter\tThreshold\tObjective\r\nThroughput (kg/hr)\t> 1,000\t> 3,600\r\nDose (kGy)\t> 0.4\t> 1\r\nDose uniformity ratio\t< 2.5\t< 1.4\r\n\r\nIn addition to system studies, Subtopic 2 will develop and demonstrate a proof of concept pilot for both of the use cases described above. This includes addressing all regulatory requirements and potentially crafting petitions to regulatory bodies describing the specific needs of distributed systems.  \r\n\r\nThe 12-month base period will focus on separate design studies for the use cases described above and progress through typical design review elements, including a system requirements review and preliminary design review. In addition, all relevant regulations will be identified.  \r\n\r\nBase period (12 month) milestones:  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Kickoff materials.

Monthly coordination meetings between the teams are anticipated to facilitate communication and successful completion of overall program goals.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: While the U.S. food supply is among the safest in the world, the FDA estimates that there are about 48 million cases of foodborne illness annually\u2014the equivalent of sickening 1 in 6 Americans each year. And each year these illnesses result in an estimated 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths. More significantly, the USDA estimates that food waste is between 30 and 40 percent of the U.S. food supply, with spoilage being a significant contributor. Based on estimates from USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service of 31 percent food loss at the retail and consumer levels, this corresponded to approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food in 2010.  Globally, about 1.4 billion tons of food is wasted every year.  From a food security perspective, the U.S. imports 94% of its seafood, 55% of fruit, and 32% of vegetables, while the FDA is only able to inspect 1-2% of these foodstuffs.  Lastly, there is a need to treat food for improved safety and stability during expeditionary operations or in environments where food quality may be compromised, such as in disaster response or humanitarian relief operations. Development of \u201cin-house,\u201d port-of-entry, or expeditionary irradiation capabilities would provide a new means to avoid or significantly improve these food safety and waste issues. For food safety applications, the availability of in-house technologies will help reduce and control costs, provide greater flexibility in managing inventory, facilitate new product formulations, protect against supply chain disruption, and decrease the impact of waste management. Being able to cold pasteurize food at points of production, import, or distribution and in austere environments could present a transformational ability to improve food safety and security and reduce the threat from natural, accidental, or intentional food contamination. Further, these sources could also be used for a range of other applications. For example, low-cost e-beam technology can be employed to remediate urgently needed capabilities to degrade per\u2013 and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater and soils. In-situ sterilization of medical devices is a further need for such sources. Overall, advancement in improving food safety, availability, and security could have global impacts and significantly advance U.S. national security agendas.  By enabling safe and secure food supplies in underdeveloped countries, there are new opportunities for the U.S. to provide additional stability in these regimes.    \r\n\r\nSuccessful proposals for this SBIR offering must make significant arguments supporting the commercial viability of their approach. Hence, proposals to Subtopic 1 must provide initial evidence that their technical approach will allow accelerator structures that are much lower cost to produce (>10-100x) and operate (>10x) than traditional accelerator systems such as S-band LINACs and rhodotrons, while still achieving required beam powers for high throughput food treatment. Proposals for Subtopic 2 must make arguments that, should the above accelerator technology be available, it would enable highly economic treatment of foodstuffs at points of production/packaging and ports of entry.  Transition and commercialization (T-C) milestones have been added as part of the option phases to aid in assuring commercial viability.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\thttps://www.aiche.org/resources/publications/cep/2016/november/introduction-electron-beam-food-irradiation\r\n2.\thttps://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/10/07/the-plan-to-give-soldiers-a-days-worth-of-mres-in-one-ration-seven-days-of-food-weighing-less-than-10-pounds/ \r\n3.\thttps://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/what-you-need-know-about-foodborne-illnesses#\r\n4.\thttps://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs# \r\n5.\thttps://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/ \r\n6.\thttps://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/february/india-and-mexico-top-sources-of-pathogen-based-u-s-food-import-refusals/\r\n7.\thttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2021.109705\r\n8.\thttps://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774110\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Food irradiation, cold pasteurization, medical sterilization, x-rays, linear accelerators, radiation dose\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2414713","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Deuce Coupe","branch":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","topic_number":"HR0011SB20234-07","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Integrated Sensing & Cyber, Trusted AI & Autonomy\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: To address supply chain shortages by providing a fast, reliable, and widely-available capability to identify, appraise, and extract valuable mechanical and electronic components from scrapped or damaged systems, for reuse in functioning systems [1-3].\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Mechanical parts recycling, and electronic waste (e-waste) reuse falls into two broad categories. The first is the recovery of valuable materials such as aluminum, steel, gold, rare earths, and lithium. This is a high-volume bulk process where the high-value manufactured components are systematically reduced to raw material [4]. \r\n\r\nThe second broad category is ad-hoc recovery through junkyards and scrap-picking. In this case, experts look through the scrap and select the parts needed\u2014a labor-intensive process that does not scale. The experts have (1) the skills to understand which parts are needed [5], (2) an encyclopedic knowledge of which systems have the needed part and where it is in the system, (3) the ability to assess whether the scrapped part appears to be functional, and (4) the expertise to safely extract the needed part [6]. \r\n\r\nToday, each of these steps requires substantial knowledge of potential donor systems. Given the plethora of donor systems (cars, trucks, phones, computers, printers) now available, and the broad understanding of available components and means of extraction, the potential utility of harvesting this vast pool of high-value resources is far above what can be done today by human experts [7]. \r\n\r\nNote: please see DARPA SBIR 23.4 - Release 4 under the DoD STTR 23.4 Annual BAA at https://www.defensesbirsttr.mil/SBIR-STTR/Opportunities/ for DARPA proposal instructions, to include duration and funding information for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. In a Deuce Coupe environment, operators equipped with high-end cell phones would be given search lists and then cued to look for the sources of needed components. Based on information from service manuals, shop manuals, disassembly information, and related sources [8], Deuce Coupe-developed software would use image-feature extraction, natural language processing, and knowledge of physical dynamics to identify systems containing the necessary components [9]. When a candidate donor system is identified, the operator is then cued as to where to find the material within the system [10, 11].   \r\n\r\nFeasibility requirements firms must meet to be considered for a Phase II award: \r\n\u2022\tAbility to create the models and structures needed to identify embedded material\r\n\u2022\tCapability to capture information from sensors to feed the inventory of material\r\nSuccess criteria for Phase I: Identification of the components needed. In Phase I, the identification will not require a pass/fail for the component [12].\r\n\r\nPHASE II: During Phase II, Deuce Coupe will use the sensors on the phone to evaluate the state of the identified components or sub-assemblies [3, 13]. A highly-skilled mechanic or technician can examine the appearance, color, and shape of parts and subsystems and then rapidly assess the part\u2019s condition and suitability for reuse [2, 14].   \r\n\r\nPhase II Milestones (Base): \r\n\u2022\tMonth 4: Demonstration of an automated, functioning workflow to take an operator from parts ingestion though populating a s design system component library\r\n\u2022\tMonth 7: Capability to ingest and identify junked systems (e.g. car, truck) and provide sufficient metadata to be able to access the parts database systems \r\n\u2022\tMonth 10: Capability to provide information on the available parts from the junked systems based on sensor input and synthesis of the metadata on the system (e.g. shop manual) \r\nPhase II Milestones (Option): \r\n\u2022\tMonth 5: Ability to assess the utility of a part based on sensor data and evaluate its capacity for reuse \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Capability to advise on preferential reuse of parts based on assessed utility of the part and information in available metadata \r\nSuccess criteria for Phase II: the components are to be identified with a reliability indicator that is accurate 80% of the time for P(working) and 90% of the time for P(failure).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Scale up to provide efficient and local resupply, measuring the ability to keep a greater quantity of systems in the field for longer periods of time, while simultaneously increasing confidence levels for systems\u2019 operational capabilities.  Expand the range of sourcing possibilities for parts and subsystems, thus allowing otherwise-incapacitated systems to be made available for operation.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tJ. Aitken and A.

Innovative approaches should address the experimental methodology for evaluating implementations of distributed trust schemes\u2014or modifications of existing schemes, such as those focused on recovery\u2014at large scales, under realistic connectivity (or intermittent connectivity) constraints, along with the required simulation framework, metrics of success, assessment methods, and integration of solutions into robust, real-time cyber defense capabilities of interest to the DoD.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. The Phase I feasibility study shall include the documentation of a basic distributed trust evaluation prototype consisting of the software code and hardware capabilities that are capable of experimenting with Research & Development (R&D) concepts of Tactical Certificate Authorities (CAs) that employ flexible policies, extensions, and protocols for battlefield use. \r\n\r\nProposers interested in submitting a Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above has been met and supports relevant military and/or commercial applications. Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to Appendix B of the DARPA Instructions for DoD BAA 2023.4.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II shall produce system design, implementation, and maintenance capabilities to significantly advance the state of the art in PKI scaling challenges for IoT and IoT-like battlespace uses. In today\u2019s Internet PKIs, simple loss-of-trust events such as an expiring PKI certificate led to massive outages of national telecom providers, major cloud computing services, and even critical transportation systems, with no effective automated means of timely recovery [1, 4-7]. Such outages, although indirect to the DoD, are likely to create major challenges for DoD operations. \r\n\r\nThere currently are limited scalable capabilities for recovering from loss-of-trust events such as expiration of trusted certificates, expiry of root-of-trust certificates, or compromises of such certificates or PKI subsystems. Despite the \u201cimpending doom\u201d of multiple Internet Root-of-Trust certificates approaching their expiry dates [2], the Internet PKI and IoT trust technologies lack well-designed technological fallbacks for recovery. When proposed, such technological fallbacks cannot be comprehensively evaluated without creating major deployments at representative scales, which are cost-prohibitive. Today, the DoD lacks the capability to experimentally test proposed distributed trust solutions at DoD-relevant scales. Although simulation technologies such as OPNET facilitate introductory training in DoD encryption protocols (e.g., [8]) and limited experimentation with proposed replacements of inefficient key management systems (e.g., [9]), these systems are limited in scale, and cannot be extended to simulate the behaviors of millions or hundreds of millions of nodes. This stymies the Government\u2019s abilities to pose cryptographic engineering challenges and to evaluate proposed solutions.   \r\n\r\nToday, our understanding of (rare) successful recovery derives from a few actual loss-of-trust events such as expiration of the trusted intermediate CA certificate of the Mozilla Firefox browser, which lead to worldwide deactivation of Firefox plugins (including critical security plugins). Mozilla recovered from this near-catastrophic event via an ad hoc manipulation of the certificates\u2019 trust paths, made possible by a serendipitous feature of the browser\u2019s trust chain validation implementation and ad hoc manipulation of the browser key store [1]. The two features that serendipitously enabled this recovery effort were used in ways not intended by their original design and not considered before the outage.   \r\n\r\nToday, there exists no rigorous sets of metrics, models, or simulations to discuss scalability requirements of trust management solutions such as hierarchical PKIs or any hybrid schemes. There is strong anecdotal evidence from industry that PKI and key management problems at scale create non-trivial operational surprises. However, lack of a common framework for evaluating research in distributed trust solutions at scale stymies progress. In particular, the challenges of recovering from loss-of-trust events or of migrating authority on a large scale have not been formalized at all, despite their increasing practical importance.   \r\n\r\nPhase II will create an experimental methodology for evaluating implementations of distributed trust schemes - or modifications of existing schemes, such as those focused on recovery - at large scales, under realistic connectivity (or intermittent connectivity) constraints. This methodology shall employ novel lightweight virtualization approaches to create simulation approaches that allow simulating relevant behaviors of up to hundreds of millions of nodes, with realistic link topologies and models. The new architectural approach to simulation shall faithfully emulate small relevant code segments of implementations under test, while aggressively aggregating non-relevant aspects of node and network behaviors. \r\n\r\nThese methodologies and simulation tools will help pose and answer operational questions about distributed trust, including introduction of new features into PKIs and KMIs, and allow creation of meaningful operational benchmarks for trust engineering. For example, they will create the capability to experimentally test in simulation whether a trust scheme is likely to perform a given mix of operations on a given scale, under given connectivity constraints, and to pose challenges for cryptographic engineering in terms of such scale benchmarks.  \r\n\r\nThe methodology shall enable the study of principled loss-of-trust recovery methods based on distributed graph algorithms, such as trust path manipulations generalizing the ad hoc Firefox recovery example. Furthermore, the methodology will allow exploration of scenarios that involve migration of the root-of-trust, which become increasingly important with the ageing of IoT roots of trust, and threats of wide-spread compromises of trusted boot chains (cf. [3]). Finally, a principled simulation framework will enable not only stochastic simulation experiments but, with modifications, will support sound reasoning about protocol properties under probabilistic network models.  \r\n\r\nEPiC EagLe will leverage formal reasoning, simulation, and modern cryptographic primitives to develop the first of its kind PKI frameworks that can recover from emergent loss of trust events. Successful offerors in their proposals will demonstrate a strong understanding of the technology area and they will articulate a compelling necessity for S&T funding to support their respective proposed technology approaches over existing capabilities.  \r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables Phase II fixed payable milestones for this program shall include:\r\n\u2022\tMonth 2: New Capabilities Report, that identifies additions and modifications that will be researched, developed, and customized for incorporation in the pilot demonstration.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 4: PI meeting presentation material, including demonstration of progress to date, PowerPoint presentations of accomplishments and plans. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Demonstration Plan that identifies schedule, location, computing resources, and any other requirements for the pilot demonstration. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 9: Initial demonstration of stand-alone pilot application to DARPA; identification of military transition partner(s) and other interested DoD organizations \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: PI meeting presentation material, including demonstration of progress to date, PowerPoint presentations of accomplishments and plans. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 15: Demonstration to military transition partners (s) and other DoD organizations. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 18: PI meeting presentation material, including demonstration of progress to date, PowerPoint presentations of accomplishments and plans. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 21: PI meeting presentation material, including demonstration of progress to date, PowerPoint presentations of accomplishments and plans. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final software and/or hardware delivery, both object and source code, for operation by DARPA or other Government personnel for additional demonstrations, with suitable documentation in a contractor proposed format.  Deliver a Final Report, including quantitative metrics on decision making benefits, costs, risks, and schedule for implementation of a full prototype capability based on the pilot demonstration, along with the novel designs of PKIs and KMIs for networks with special link, bandwidth, and latency requirements and constraints. This report shall include an identification of estimated level of effort to integrate the pilot capability into an operational environment, addressing computing infrastructure and environment, decision making processes, real-time and archival data sources, maintenance and updating needs; reliability, sensitivity, and uncertainty quantification; and transferability to other military users and problems. The report shall also document any scientific advances that have been achieved under the program. (A brief statement of claims supplemented by publication material will meet this requirement.) Provide Final PI meeting presentation material.  \r\n\r\nPhase II Option: The option shall address preliminary steps toward the certification, accreditation and/or verification of the resulting base effort's sound experimental methodologies and operational benchmarks for evaluating distributed trust solutions. Proposed solutions shall include a summary of how the methodologies are likely to succeed on DoD and IoT scales and under link, bandwidth, and latency constraints specific to DoD environments and missions. \r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables for Phase II Option: Phase II fixed payable milestones for this program option shall include:  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 2: Plan that identifies the schedule, location, computing resources and/or any other requirements for the experimental methodologies and operational benchmarks and infrastructure for evaluating distributed trust solutions required for transition to the DoD. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 4: Presentation on the detailed software and hardware plan for the technical capability. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 7: Interim report on progress toward certification, accreditation and/or verification of the technical capability for DoD use.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 10: Review and/or demonstration of the prototype capability with the documentation supporting certification, accreditation and/or verification.   \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Final Phase II option report summarizing the certification, accreditation and/or verification approach, architecture and algorithms; data sets; results; performance characterization and quantification of robustness.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The DoD and the commercial world have similar challenges with respect to maintaining the cyber integrity of their computing and communications infrastructure.  The Phase III effort will see the developed methodology and testbed transitioned into a DoD cyber environment capable of testing large-scale software deployments (including distributed trust software) in simulations consisting of virtual machines (VMs), up to tens of thousands of emulated nodes. Government ranges and commercial systems such as national telecom providers, major cloud computing services, and critical transportation systems have similar challenges in their PKI and KMI infrastructures and face severe scaling challenges for IoT and IoT-like battlespace uses. Thus, the resulting methodology and operational benchmarks are directly transitionable to both the DoD and the commercial sectors: military and commercial air, sea, space and ground communication systems; commercial hardening of critical industrial plant (i.e. control systems, manufacturing lines, chemical processes, etc.) through PKI and KMI infrastructures; securing cloud infrastructure associated with optimization of industrial processes and condition-based maintenance of air, sea, space and ground networked communication systems.\r\n\r\nAs part of Phase III, the developed capability should be transitioned into an enterprise level system that can be used to test large-scale software deployments (including distributed trust software) in simulations consisting of virtual machines (VMs), up to tens of thousands of emulated nodes. The resulting capability is directly transitionable to the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, and the National Security Agency for experimenting with Research & Development (R&D) concepts of Tactical Certificate Authorities (CAs) that employ flexible policies, extensions, and protocols for battlefield use. This is a dual-use technology that applies to both military and commercial software environments affected by cyber adversaries.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tEric Rescorla, Technical Details on the Recent Firefox Add-on Outage, https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/technical-details-on-the-recent-firefox-add-on-outage/\r\n2.\tScott Helme, The Impending Doom of Expiring Root CAs and Legacy Clients, https://scotthelme.co.uk/impending-doom-root-ca-expiring-legacy-clients/\r\n3.\tMark Ermolov, Intel x86 Root of Trust: loss of trust, http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2020/03/intelx86-root-of-trust-loss-of-trust.html\r\n4.\tCorinne Reichert, Ericsson: Expired certificate caused O2 and SoftBank outages, https://www.zdnet.com/article/ericsson-expired-certificate-caused-o2-and-softbank-outages/,  2018\r\n5.\tJohn Ribeiro, Microsoft's Azure service hit by expired SSL certificate, https://www.computerworld.com/article/2495453/microsoft-s-azure-service-hit-by-expired-ssl-certificate.html, 2013\r\n6.\tDennis Fisher, Final Report on DigiNotar Hack Shows Total Compromise of CA Servers, https://threatpost.com/final-report-diginotar-hack-shows-total-compromise-ca-servers-103112/77170/,  2012\r\n7.\tNihal Krishan, Internet goes down for millions, tech companies scramble as key encryption service, expires, https://www.yahoo.com/now/internet-goes-down-millions-tech-021400230.html, 2021\r\n8.\tTae H.

Assess potential security vulnerabilities in polyglot approaches.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: DoD employees are interacting with physical-cyber data transfers at an ever-increasing rate; simply walking through an airport might require scanning 2-dimensional (2D) codes numerous times to receive basic goods and services, such as food menus and flight boarding passes. One of the most prevalent types of 2D codes is Quick Response (QR) code originating in 1994 from a Japanese automotive company. With the widespread adoption of mobile phones, QR codes have become a standard to store and transfer data in a physical format. The convenience that QR codes provide comes with certain limitations, such as the amount of data it can store and a balance between usability and security. 2D codes (e.g., QR codes, Data Matrix, MaxiCode, PDF417) are designed and optimized for a specific task; for example, data matrix codes used by shipping are fast to scan, however they only store 1.55kb of data as compared to 3kb for QR v4. 2D codes are often represented pictographically as part of printed media, such as a menu in a restaurant. They have low data density as a result of error correction and robustness to environmental effects (e.g., scratches). To increase the data density, preserve the inherent optimizations of each format, and ensure backwards compatibility, this study will investigate combining formats into 2D polyglots. In this context, a polyglot is a format that is valid in multiple computer programs. Polyglots are possible by combining two or more formats, each of which are able to be interpreted by multiple programs as having a valid format, for example, a file which is both a picture and a PowerPoint presentation.       \r\n\r\nThis study will investigate the effects that 2D polyglots have in QR codes and their potential to reduce the attack surface and increase data density.  A basis of confidence that polyglots can exist in 2D codes is the known, trivial case of a 2D code imbedded in another 2D code [D14]. For more than a decade it has been widely known that current 2D codes have inherent vulnerabilities [D15, F19, K10]. Usability was heavily favored over security in the design of these codes. This imbalance led to a widely adopted standard with pervasive vulnerabilities. Attacks can take advantage of error correction algorithms and data sparsity to exploit 2D formatting assumptions and the inconsistences which software makes when interpreting a 2D code. For example, standard QR codes have orientation markers and data is only parsed in one direction; polyglot QR codes can contain multiple, non-conflicting formats that can be read independently based on approach direction.Finally, to ensure current systems and software can still be used, any enhancements to the SOTA must also be backwards compatible. Introducing new software and standards would inevitably have new and possibly unintended effects on security and efficiency.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only.   Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above have been met and describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 documentation should include:   \r\n\u2022\tTechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, and risks/mitigations, and assessments;  \r\n\u2022\tPresentation materials and/or white papers; \r\n\u2022\tTechnical papers; \r\n\u2022\tTest and measurement data; \r\n\u2022\tPrototype designs/models; \r\n\u2022\tPerformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and, \r\n\u2022\tDocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed SUP solution can enable more realistic cyber training.    \r\nThis collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and ability in networking, computer science, mathematics, and software engineering. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD BAA and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The goal of 2D Polyglots is to develop a QR code that can hold more data while maintaining backwards compatibility and to identify vulnerabilities present in current 2D codes.DP2 proposals should propose a research design to achieve the following goals: \r\n\u2022\tDevelop a protype system to demonstrate feasibility for producing 2D polyglots in a platform independent language (e.g., python 3.0, Golang);\r\n\u2022\tIdentify vulnerabilities and possible mitigations in 2D and 2D polyglot codes;  \r\n\u2022\tDetail a test plan, complete with proposed metrics and scope, for verification and validation of the system performance.   \r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a system demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program. The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II effort.    \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) (in person or virtual, as needed) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation.  \r\n\u2022\tMonths 3, 4, 5: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this will normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM (in-person or virtual as needed) detailing progress made (include quantitative assessment of capability developed to date), tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, planned activities, and technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 7, 8, 9: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 10/Final Phase II Deliverables: Final architecture with documented details, demonstrating diagnosing a malicious activity and unauthorized modification on software/hardware; documented application programming interfaces; any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the end of phase commercialization plan).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed 2-D Polyglots technologies. The proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype software into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in military or private sector markets. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program.  Outcomes have the potential to significantly benefit the DoD and numerous commercial entities by improving knowledge of 2D codes including capabilities and vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the DoD space, 2D Polyglots technologies will be able to provide new data transfer methods utilizing 2D codes and highlight any potential vulnerabilities in current 2D codes used across the DoD enterprise. The development of polyglot technologies will have security benefits across the defense industrial base (DIB).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tDabrowski, A., Krombholz, K., Ullrich, J. and Weippl, E.R., 2014, November.

The inherent asymmetry of effort required to defend an asset vs. effort to gain illicit access to an asset favors attackers that can spend as much time as necessary to locate vulnerable targets (e.g., a server that administrators neglected to patch [5], or a network configured with overly permissive firewall policies [6]). In such an environment where the attacker is advantaged,  network administrators and security officers practice defense in depth [7] [8] by reducing the network attack surface and deploying an array of security mechanisms and technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection/ prevention systems. The extent of an organization\u2019s efforts to minimize network attack surfaces and deploy defensive mechanisms can be largely unknown (e.g., due to poor documentation), even to the organization itself [9]. Often and unfortunately, details about the deployed security mechanisms (or the lack thereof) are only made available after an organization\u2019s network is compromised, and when forensic analysts conduct a postmortem of the attack [10] [11]. For the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC), the same problem exists and is compounded by the distinction between, and respective operational responsibilities of, network owners/operators and defenders such as Cybersecurity Service Provider (CSSPs) and Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs). Within the DoD/IC, CPTs are tasked with defending critical military networks; whereas CSSPs are responsible for the continuous monitoring and vulnerability patching of networks, and conducting threat-oriented missions to defeat cyber adversaries. [12] Similar to commercial organizations, critical details of  network topology, configuration [13], and security posture [14] are often poorly documented and not immediately available to external responders (such as CPTs). An additional complicating factor of having network knowledge spread among different organizations and individuals (CPTs and CSSPs) is that it makes it difficult to have an accurate holistic picture of the security posture of lower-tier networks at any given time. It is therefore of critical importance for the DoD/IC and large commercial network owners to be able to quickly and passively assess the defensive posture of a remote network/subnetwork in a way that does not require any special access to the network.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The PARQER SBIR topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only, which must include supporting documentation of Phase 1 feasibility. Phase I feasibility must be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of system properties/technology capabilities desirable for DoD/IC/Government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).     Entities interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific/technical merit and feasibility described above has been achieved and also describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 Phase I feasibility documentation should include, at a minimum:   \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD/IC insertion opportunity, risks/mitigations, and technology assessments;  \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers; \r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers; \r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data; \r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models; \r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and, \r\n\u2022\tdocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed PARQER solution can enable passive, remote assessment of network/subnetwork security posture.    \r\nThe collection of Phase I feasibility material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in the technical areas of software engineering, data analytics, network security, and cybersecurity. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD Broad Agency Announcement and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The PARQER DP2 SBIR topic seeks to develop and demonstrate novel techniques to enable passive assessment of the security posture of remote networks/subnetworks, without requiring any special access to the network.    Most current tools and techniques employed by security operations centers are based on active interrogation. The tools and techniques are often too noisy (e.g., high volumes of alerts and high false positive rates), do not generalize across security mechanisms (i.e., the tools are siloed), and have significant blind spots (e.g., false negatives).   Ideal PARQER solutions would overcome such limitations of active techniques, as well as be resistant to intentional misdirection and evasion. PARQER solutions must have the ability to provably scale yet provide fine resolution of the analyzed network. Successful PARQER proposals should clearly describe how proposed combinations of data and analytic techniques will provide high accuracy results in a landscape of ever-evolving security products.Phase II will culminate in a prototype system demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program (e.g., Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE), which seeks to develop data-driven tools to automate the planning and execution of threat-emulated cyber infrastructure needed for network security assessments).   The Phase II Option period will further mature the technology for insertion into a DoD/Intelligence Community (IC) Acquisition Program, another Federal agency; or commercialization into the private sector.  The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II and Phase II Option period efforts.   \r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal, including the below: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation; \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM;  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM;\r\n\u2022\tMonths 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM;  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the passive assessment of the security posture of remote networks/subnetworks; documented APIs; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the commercialization plan);  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 30 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization; and, \r\n\u2022\tMonth 36 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period demonstration and technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics of system performance.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III Dual use applications (Commercial DoD/Military): PARQER has potential applicability across DoD/IC/Government and commercial entities. For DoD/IC/Government, PARQER is extremely well-suited to address one of the biggest issues in government information security today by providing the ability to quickly and passively assess the defensive posture of a remote network/subnetwork. PARQER has the same applicability for the commercial sector.  Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed PARQER technologies. For Phase III, the proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in government or private sector markets.  Primary PARQER support will be to national efforts to help secure government and commercial networks. Results of PARQER are intended to improve the ability of network owners across government and industry to quickly find the root causes of network compromise incidents, and rapidly mitigate the situation, ultimately improving the security posture of their networks.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tPortSwigger. 2022.

In other scenarios around the world, populations have sought private and secure solutions to circumvent restrictions on internet access placed on them by authoritarian regimes. It is therefore unsurprising that commercial VPN services have experienced substantial increases in demand over recent years [1, 2, 3]. The surge in VPN service demand has caused an increase in supply to the extent that (for example) the Google Play Store houses several hundred different apps that offer free (for examples, see [4]) and paid VPN services advertising increased privacy, high-speed bandwidth, large numbers of egress servers,  access to censored websites, etc. [5] Even though users may be able to easily differentiate between fast and slow VPN services by merely using the service, unfortunately there are no outward signs they can use to quantify the privacy provided by VPN services. As such, users who employ such services to increase their privacy, may in fact be revealing their data to remote networks of less trustworthiness than their own local networks [6, 7]. It is therefore important to be able to proactively and continuously evaluate the properties and quality of protection that a commercial VPN solution offers. With rare exception [8], existing reviews of VPN services are typically conducted by technology journalists and are therefore limited to assessments of the VPN performance (e.g., speed), price, user friendliness (e.g., ease-of-use), features and supported protocols (e.g., see [9]).The AVN SBIR topic seeks to address this shortfall by developing and demonstrating techniques and systems for automatically analyzing third-party commercial VPN solutions to determine their networthiness, where networthiness considerations align with those of the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) [10].\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The AVN SBIR topic is soliciting Direct to Phase 2 (DP2) proposals only, which must include supporting documentation of Phase I feasibility. Phase I feasibility must be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of system properties/technology capabilities desirable for DoD/IC/government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).  Entities interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific/technical merit and feasibility described above has been achieved and also describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 Phase I feasibility documentation should include, at a minimum: \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD/IC insertion opportunity, risks/mitigations, and technology assessments; \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers;\r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers;\r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data;\r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models;\r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and,\r\n\u2022\tdocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed AVN solution can enable accurate and reliable analysis of third- party VPN solutions.  \r\nThe collection of Phase 1 feasibility material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in the technical areas of software engineering, network security, privacy, analytics, and machine learning. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD Broad Agency Announcement and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The AVN DP2 SBIR topic seeks to develop and demonstrate techniques and systems for automatically analyzing third-party commercial VPN solutions to determine the actual operational privacy profile/performance of such services. AVN solutions will provide an objective quantification of the privacy-related performance of third-party VPN services across platforms (e.g., Android, iPhone, PC, MAC, Ubuntu, etc.). Ideal solutions would require limited manual intervention and not rely on information elicited by the VPN service provider. AVN approaches will need to provably scale with the large number of available and future commercial VPN services. Ideally, AVN solutions would enable a user to tailor analyses to specific requirements as VPNs offer varying privacy protections that are not uniformly valuable to every user. DP2 proposals should:\r\n\u2022\tdescribe a proposed framework design/architecture to achieve the above stated goals;\r\n\u2022\tpresent a plan for maturation of the framework to a demonstrable prototype system; and\r\n\u2022\tdetail a test plan, complete with proposed quantitative metrics for privacy, and for verification and validation of the prototype system performance. \r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a prototype system demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program, for example, the Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE) [11] program, which seeks to develop data-driven tools to automate the planning and execution of threat-emulated cyber infrastructure needed for network security assessments.\r\n\r\nThe Phase II Option period will further mature the technology for insertion into a DoD/ IC Acquisition Program, another Federal agency, or commercialization into the private sector.\r\n\r\nThe below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II and Phase II Option period efforts.\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal, including the below:\r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation. \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the ability to automatically analyze third-party commercial VPN solutions; documented application programming interfaces; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the commercialization plan). \r\n\u2022\tMonth 30 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 36 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics for assessment of privacy features/capabilities.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: AVN has potential applicability across DoD/IC/government and commercial entities. For DoD/IC/government, AVN is extremely well-suited for proactive and continuous assessment of privacy features/performance of various VPN services. AVN has the same applicability for the commercial sector and has the potential to provide individuals worldwide with reliable private connections and communications.  Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed AVN technologies. For Phase III, the proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in government or private sector markets.  Primary AVN support will be to national efforts to help secure government, commercial, and personal networks and devices against advanced persistent threats that target vulnerable VPN devices.

A vehicle\u2019s distributed network of ECUs is responsible for the control/functionality of the engine and transmission system, as well as for the control/functionality of the vehicle\u2019s comfort and entertainment systems. Due to the extensive and growing use of ECUs in modern vehicles, and the associated increased costs and complexities they bring (e.g., due to multiple manufacturers, system integration requirements) [2], many vehicle manufacturers have adapted their manufacturing models and design flows to use the intellectual property of third-party ECU manufacturers, and outsource the fabrication of ECU hardware to offshore foundries to reduce the cost and time-to-market for their vehicles. Unfortunately, outsourcing ECU fabrication raises important security concerns [3, 4] for intelligent vehicles used by the civilian sector as well as US expeditionary forces abroad.The various Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks (e.g., Cellular, Local and Personal Area Networks, Low Power Wide Area Networks, and Mesh networks [5]) and the continuing increases in the scale of networked systems offers unprecedented interconnectivity of electronic devices, to include ECUs. Because of the ubiquitous nature and large attack surfaces of IoT networks, threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service attacks, and hijacking of services attacks [6] can be successfully executed through bypassing the authentication process of ECUs. The consequences of such attacks can increase in severity if the ECUs are tampered with during production [7, 8, 9], prior to installation in the vehicle. Therefore, it is critical to have the ability to securely authenticate vehicular ECUs and to continuously monitor them for detection of malicious activity.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The ECU2A SBIR topic is soliciting DP2 proposals only, which must include supporting documentation of Phase I feasibility. Phase I feasibility must be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of system properties/technology capabilities desirable for DoD/IC/government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).     Entities interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific/technical merit and feasibility described above has been achieved and also describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 Phase I feasibility documentation should include, at a minimum:   \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD/IC insertion opportunity, risks/mitigations, and technology assessments;  \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers; \r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers; \r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data; \r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models;\r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and, \r\n\u2022\tdocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed ECU2A solution can enable secure authentication and continuous monitoring of ECUs in modern intelligent vehicles.     \r\nThe collection of Phase I feasibility material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in the technical areas of software engineering, network security, cyber security, analytics, and machine learning.

Strong ECU2A proposals should address several technical challenges, such as:\r\n\u2022\teffective tools and algorithms for one-time ECU authentication and continuous ECU monitoring schemes;\r\n\u2022\tmodels capable of rapidly identifying compromised ECUs;.\r\n\u2022\tECU software/hardware validation techniques, prior to and after installment;\r\n\u2022\tzero-overhead, non-intrusive monitoring schemes, that do not require direct ECU access, for easy and secure deployment;\r\n\u2022\ttechniques to rapidly minimize the connection/communication between the source of malicious activity and a targeted ECU;\r\n\u2022\tcapabilities to detect hardware/software trojans with no reverse-engineering techniques;\r\n\u2022\tmonitoring methods for devices operating on a broad range of ECU components, and which have an air-gapped nature.\r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a demonstration of the application and validation of ECU2A-developed technologies for detecting malicious activity against one or more concrete technological use cases of integrated software systems.Schedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal, including the below: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation.  \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM.

An organization\u2019s enterprise security controls aim to protect the organization\u2019s networks against threats from hackers, malicious software, and attempts to steal sensitive information [1]. Threat hunting and incident response tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by an organization\u2019s cyber security operations teams help protect the networks by continuously monitoring for threats in progress that evade security controls and breach the network [2]. Despite significant investment in enterprise security controls, and the collection and use of diverse and voluminous datasets for threat hunting and incident response, many organizations lack the infrastructure capacity and resources to store key enterprise network security data in a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective way, for durations comparable to the average dwell time [3] of cyber attackers (i.e., the amount of time an attacker spends on a target network before being detected). Dwell times, which vary based on region and other factors, can average up to two months, giving attackers plenty of time to wreak havoc on the target network [4]. In addition, shortfalls in infrastructure capacity and resources adversely impacts an organization\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively conduct incident response forensics on the network security data, once intrusion is detected.Organizations across government and industry would benefit from a simple, yet powerful, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective mechanism to support automated retention, retrieval, and analysis of key enterprise network data for security operations teams to conduct incident response forensics, such as root cause analysis [5] and lateral movement [6] detection, ex post facto.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The Network Black Box SBIR topic is soliciting Direct to Phase 2 (DP2) proposals only, which must include supporting documentation of Phase 1 feasibility. Phase I feasibility must be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of system properties/technology capabilities desirable for DoD/IC/government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).

DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in the technical areas of cyber operations, software engineering, network security, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD Broad Agency Announcement and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The Network Black Box DP2 SBIR topic seeks to develop and demonstrate a system prototype capable of automatically retaining, retrieving, and analyzing network data to support threat detection and response efforts by security operations teams. It is envisioned that Network Black Box approaches will take the form of a physical or virtual appliance with an intuitive user interface supporting at least the two use cases stated previously, namely root cause analysis and lateral movement detection. Proposed solutions should enable organizations to retain and analyze enterprise network data for at least one year for a network consisting of at least 10,000 hosts. Strong Network Black Box proposals will provide experimental evidence and a quantitative analysis on the cost, capacity, and scalability of such a capability, and present preliminary evidence on the usefulness of the retained data for root cause analysis, lateral movement detection, and any additional use cases.\r\n\r\nDP2 proposals should:\r\n\u2022\tdescribe a proposed framework design/architecture to achieve the above stated goals;\r\n\u2022\tpresent a plan for maturation of the framework to a demonstrable prototype system; and\r\n\u2022\tdetail a test plan, complete with proposed quantitative metrics for verification and validation of the prototype system performance.\r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a prototype system demonstration using compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into a DARPA program (e.g., the Cyber Agents for Security Testing and Learning Environments (CASTLE) [7] program which seeks to generate data-driven, machine-readable descriptions of how attacker tools behave, how attack paths unfold, and how to label observable attack behavior; and the Signature Management using Operational Knowledge and Environments (SMOKE) [8] program which seeks to assist red teams with planning with deploying TTPs to evade network defenders in order to achieve assessment objectives (e.g., lateral movement in networks) and assess how networks perform against malicious cyber actors (MCAs)).\r\n\r\nThe Phase II Option period will further mature the technology for insertion into a DoD/ IC Acquisition Program, another Federal agency, or commercialization into the private sector.The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II and Phase II Option period efforts.\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal, including the below:\r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation. \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the ability to automatically retain, retrieve, and analyze network data to support threat detection and response efforts by security operations teams; documented application programming interfaces; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the commercialization plan). \r\n\u2022\tMonth 30 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization.\r\n\u2022\tMonth 36 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics for assessment of privacy features/capabilities.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Network Black Box has potential applicability across DoD/IC/government and commercial entities. For DoD/IC/government, Network Black Box is extremely well-suited for forensic analysts tasked with conducting postmortems after an organization\u2019s network is compromised. Network Black Box has the same applicability for the commercial sector.  Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed Network Black Box technologies. For Phase III, the proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in government or private sector markets.  Primary Network Black Box support will be to national efforts to help secure government and commercial networks against MCAs that target critical networks. Results of Network Black Box are intended to improve understanding of MCA threats and improve detection and response actions across government and industry.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tNIST SP 800-53 Revision 5. 2020. \u201cSecurity and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.\u201d https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf\r\n2.\tWaqas, Iam.

The focus of 5GTE is to provide an open-source, realistic 5G radio access network to enable rapid prototyping of wireless protocols and applications including, but not limited to: cyber security, artificial intelligence, and edge-computing. \r\n\r\nA key requirement of 5GTE is the ability to rapidly and accurately scale as new technologies and devices are introduced/become available. 5GTE must also provide remote access and device update capabilities. \r\nTo broaden the range of supported devices and to facilitate development, 5GTE should have the ability to support different wireless communication technologies (e.g., fourth generation, wireless fidelity).\r\n5GTE\u2019s network access should support high-fidelity quality of service for experimentation with different 3rd Generation Partnership (3GPP) [1] Project Release 17 [2] use cases.\r\n\r\nWhile open-source 5G testbed architectures do exist [3], they do not fully support remote accessibility and management to allow for multiple experiments and tests to co-exist simultaneously.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: The 5GTE SBIR topic is soliciting DP2 proposals only, which must include supporting documentation of Phase I feasibility. Phase I feasibility must be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed proof of concept/principal or basic prototype system; definition and characterization of system properties/technology capabilities desirable for DoD/IC/government and civilian/commercial use; and capability/performance comparisons with existing state-of-the-art technologies/methodologies (competing approaches).     \r\n\r\nEntities interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific/technical merit and feasibility described above has been achieved and also describe the potential commercial applications. DP2 Phase I feasibility documentation should include, at a minimum:   \r\n\u2022\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD/IC insertion opportunity, risks/mitigations, and technology assessments;  \r\n\u2022\tpresentation materials and/or white papers; \r\n\u2022\ttechnical papers; \r\n\u2022\ttest and measurement data; \r\n\u2022\tprototype designs/models;\r\n\u2022\tperformance projections, goals, or results in different use cases; and, \r\n\u2022\tdocumentation of related topics such as how the proposed 5GTE solution can enable research and development of nascent 5G technologies.     \r\n\r\nThe collection of Phase I feasibility material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and abilities in the technical areas of: mobile communications, software engineering, network security, cyber security, programmable networking, and artificial intelligence. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD Broad Agency Announcement and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The objective of the 5GTE DP2 SBIR topic is to develop a scalable, open-source IoT 5G test environment capability to support research and development of nascent 5G technologies.\r\n5GTE DP2 proposals should:\r\n1.\tdescribe a proposed design/architecture to achieve the 5GTE goals, along with application programming interfaces that allow for an open IoT testbed infrastructure;\r\n2.\tpresent a plan for maturation of the architecture to a prototype testbed to demonstrate accurate and scalable experimentation capabilities; and,\r\n3.\tdetail a test plan, complete with proposed metrics and scope (e.g., testbed structure, types/numbers of devices, etc.) for verification and validation of the testbed capabilities.\r\n\r\n5GTE should have the ability to support multiple isolated environments to enable testing in parallel with security guarantees. Each isolated environment would support full standards compliant user authentication on the 5G core side, where the end devices can use programmable subscriber identity module cards; and the core would support network slicing capabilities.\r\nStrong 5GTE proposals would include:\r\n\u2022\tadditional scaling capabilities enabled via emulation of various end devices; \r\n\u2022\tsolutions based on components with strong open-source development and community support, such as the technology projects that reside within the Linux Foundation [5]; and,\r\n\u2022\ta commercialization plan for the proposed 5GTE which articulates a clear vision for the potential business opportunities as 5G capabilities and standards evolve.\r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a testbed demonstration using one or more compelling IoT use cases consistent with commercial opportunities and/or insertion into the DARPA/I2O Open, Programmable, Secure 5G (OPS-5G) program [4]. The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end product for the DP2 effort.\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Proposers will execute the research and development (R&D) plan as described in the proposal, including the below: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Phase I Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation.  \r\n\u2022\tMonths 4, 7, 10: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 12: Interim technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM detailing progress made (including quantitative assessment of capabilities developed to date), tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, planned activities, technical plan for the second half of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 15, 18, 21: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 4, 7, and 10), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 24: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM. Final architecture with documented details; a demonstration of the ability to authenticate, monitor, and detect malicious activities in ECUs; documented application programming interfaces; and any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the commercialization plan).  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 30 (Phase II Option period): Interim report of matured prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, documenting key technical gaps towards productization. \r\n\u2022\tMonth 36 (Phase II Option period): Final Phase II Option period technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM including prototype performance against existing state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative metrics for assessment of test environment features/capabilities.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: 5GTE has potential applicability across DoD/IC/government and commercial entities. For DoD/IC/government, 5GTE is extremely well-suited for supporting research to investigate 5G capability enhancements and cyber risks. 5GTE has the same applicability for the commercial sector.\r\n\r\nPhase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. The Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed 5GTE technologies. For Phase III, the proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in government or private sector markets.  \r\n\r\nPrimary 5GTE support will be to national efforts to advance US 5G capabilities and to promote awareness of 5G risks to national security. Results of 5GTE are intended to enable accurate test and evaluation of nascent 5G technologies at scale, across government and industry.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\t3GPP. 3GPP - A Global Initiative. https://www.3gpp.org/ \r\n2.\t3GPP. 3GPP \u2013 The 5G Standard. https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies/releases/release-17 \r\n3.\tInstitute for the Wireless Internet of  Things at Northeastern University.

Autonomous solutions can be powerful force multipliers, reallocating the burden of these tasks to machines and decreasing risks to personnel. For example, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operations often involve a human technician following written instructions to execute procedures on well-understood ordnance, either by hand or by remotely operating Unmanned Systems (UxS). Removing humans from the blast radius will not only decrease risk but also allow personnel to prioritize novel first-seen threats.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDeveloping autonomous solutions for well-defined problems comes with a range of challenges that differ by domain. For example, ground-based systems can encounter environmental obstacles while interacting with clutter, aerial vehicle utility is often limited by power capacity, and unmanned underwater vehicles suffer from communications limitations. Additionally, fielded systems often do not have interoperable architectures. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDARPA solicits technologies to address the critical limitations of creating autonomous solutions for well-defined problems. Examples of technologies of interest include but are not limited to systems that: \r\n\r\n1. Build or repair damaged infrastructure (e.g., repairing many blast craters in parallel and with minimal human oversight). \r\n\r\n2. Decrease the operator-to-robot ratio in UxS response operations (e.g., allowing a single operator to quickly neutralize large numbers of explosive threats in a near-peer conflict). \r\n\r\n3. Reduce the manpower requirements of physical burdens (e.g, unloading cargo at an expeditionary base).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nStrong proposals will identify a critical limitation to scalable autonomy, then design a system and/or component that overcomes the problem. Proposers should identify metrics that compare the proposed concept with the deployed state of the art. The aim of the solicitation is to create an unclassified prototype that is ready for field testing at the end of Phase II. Submissions solely focused on software or solely focused on hardware without significant autonomy are not of interest, nor are proposed solutions in the areas of kinetic effects or intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Systems developed should be robust and maximize operational availability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn initial white paper describing the technical approach is required and will be screened for responsiveness to the topic. The technical white paper should include an overview of the proposed concept with details to support feasibility. The overview should address the bullets below listed in order of importance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProposed system: Describe the proposed system. Outline the design and operation of the main hardware and software components that are being proposed for development and if applicable, which parts of the system are COTS.\u00a0 \r\n\tConcept of Employment: Identify how the proposed system could be employed. Provide details on the problem the autonomous system is addressing and the prevalence of this problem. What metric does the proposed solution improve, and by how much?\r\n\tScalability: Provide a brief analysis of the feasibility of scaling the system across the DoD and industry. Are the production costs low enough to merit widespread adoption? Is the system sufficiently autonomous that large-scale deployment wouldn\u2019t require significant training or human labor? What are the projected maintenance requirements, operational availabilities, and service lifetimes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Companies will complete a feasibility study that demonstrates the firm\u2019s competitive technical advantage relative to other commercial products (if other products exist) and develop concept plans for how the company\u2019s technology can be applied to more efficiently scale autonomous capability. Studies should clearly detail and identify a firm\u2019s technology at both the individual component and system levels, provide supporting literature for technical feasibility, highlight existing performance data, showcase the technology\u2019s application opportunities to a broad base of customers outside the defense space, a market strategy for the commercial space, how the technology directly increases the prevalence of autonomous capability as well as include a technology development roadmap to demonstrate scientific and engineering viability.\u00a0 Proposers should recommend quarterly technical milestones that will be used to demonstrate their progress to DARPA throughout Phase I. These milestones will also be accompanied by monthly financial and technical summary reports.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt the end of Phase I, the company will be required to provide a formal proposal in writing, to include quarterly milestones, defining how their technology would be developed and implemented into relevant concepts of operation. A commercialization roadmap will also be required to demonstrate a high probability that continued design and development will result in a Phase II mature product. For example, a proposal that addresses infrastructure repair might describe how the solution(s) would be employed in expeditionary military construction operations, how it nests into a broader commercial need, and specify what performance metrics (threshold and objective) would demonstrate system viability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Produce prototype solutions that enable mission essential tasks. These products will be provided to select DoD units for further evaluation by personnel. In addition, companies will provide a technology transition and commercialization plan for DOD and commercial markets.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Components and/or systems could be applied to scale autonomy in multiple industries, including but not limited to, those within the energy and construction sectors that leverage UxS in survey or infrastructure development tasks.\u00a0 These same technologies have DOD application in the air, ground, and underwater domains. The business will transition the solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range or potential Government and civilian users and alternate mission applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tB.N.

Such parachute systems will need to be capable of forcing air into parachute cells to keep them inflated during flight over long distances, with ultimate range being a function of the capabilities of this forced air system. Proposers should include any testing capabilities needed to verify that the modified canopy is in an airworthy (jumpable) configuration, without significant impact to the probability of a successful opening.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Parachute technology has evolved (Figure 1) since the creation of round canopies, which slow the rate of descent by creating drag. Ram-air canopies, developed in the 1970s, have inflatable parallel cells that fill with high-pressure air from vents that face forward on the leading edge of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped, and the parachute lines trimmed under load, such that the ballooning fabric inflates into a cambered airfoil shape. Air must flow faster over the top than the bottom, creating lift in addition to drag, and allowing steerability by controlled deflection of air. The use of airplane terminology is no accident; ram-air canopy designs share many features with airplane wings.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Evolution of parachute technology, demonstrating the steady growth toward rigid wing-like structures. CHUTE aims to redesign the canopy wing for long-distance, low-altitude flight with an airplane philosophy in mind.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn order to create a new paradigm for quiet, long-distance, low-altitude flight using parachutes, DARPA seeks to leverage recent advances in aerodynamics and materials technology to develop cost-effective ram-air parachutes that deliver a revolutionary leap in the distance that can be traversed, without significantly adding to the mass of the overall parachute rig or impacting its airworthiness (defined here as \u201cjumpability\u201d, the probability of a successful parachute opening).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s state of the art is dynamic, maneuverable cross-braced canopies used in the competitive high-speed sport of parachute swooping. Swooping canopies can generate speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour, traverse lengths greater than a football field at one foot above ground level (AGL), change direction abruptly when flying around \u201cgates\u201d, and land on a specific target with accuracy. Zero porosity aerodynamic parachute material, span-wise inflatable ribs, low drag lines, a more rigid wing-like design, and high wing loading allow finer control in close proximity to the ground, sometimes simply by shifting weight in the harness. However, modern parachutes ultimately remain a prisoner to energy conservation. Swoopers generate high kinetic energy by trading for potential energy (altitude over a drop zone). When this kinetic energy is exhausted, they must land, placing physics limits on speed and distance they can traverse. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPowered paragliders are one way that sustained flight may be possible. However, three limitations place constraints on the use of these systems for military operations: noise, weight and speed. Powered paragliders can create in excess of 120 dB of sound, typically weigh >250 lbs, and have large parafoils with dozens of cells, resulting in parasitic drag that limits sustained speed to <30 mph. Powered paragliders are therefore out of scope for this effort. The Joint Precision Aerial Descent System (JPADS) has used winches, wires and pulleys located below the parachute to demonstrate lightweight, adjustable airflow control on round parachutes, but is ultimately constrained by the round canopy\u2019s limited maneuverability. Round canopies are therefore out of scope for this effort. Concepts that rely exclusively on powered cargo and do not add propulsion to the parachute canopy (e.g. LRPADS [2]) are out of scope. For more information on this topic, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_kqMjz94B8.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I consists of a base period of six months that will result in the development, design, and refinement of a low-mass (<50 kg) parachute system design capable of long-distance (>10 km) flight, to create continuously inflated parachute cells at altitudes of 1000-3000 ft. AGL. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSuccessful proposals for this SBIR offering must make significant arguments supporting the ability to rapidly iterate and execute to meet the timelines laid out in this solicitation, while addressing three key aspects of the program goals: (1) how the method of powered propulsion or forced air will be integrated into the parachute wing and/or jumper; (2) to what degree such propulsion interacts with, or relies upon, ground effect aerodynamics and canopy wing design; (3) how the parachute and powered propulsion system will be built and tested via real-world jump operations planned for Phase II. Successful proposals will also demonstrate in-depth knowledge of aerodynamic design and parachute fabrication, and should illustrate how their method might be expected to meet the envisioned metrics.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis effort is expected to primarily center around new active airflow control and/or powered motor methods, that are conformally integrated with ram-air parachutes and allow sustained flight for as long as that control or power is provided. Methods such as adjustable inlet control, battery-powered bleed air for directional control, laminar flow injection, boundary layer control to maintain lift across long traverse distances, or other innovative methods, are suitable for investigation. Recent developments have shown that designed geometric openings can create macro-control with new wing shapes, or the opening/closing of slots or voids for air flow (e.g., ram air parachutes with controllable flaps for directional control). Additional efforts to minimize drag may be required to maximize range.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase I fixed payable milestones for this program should include:\u00a0 \r\n\r\nPhase I Base period (required): 6 months \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonth 2: Concept Design Review (CoDR) on powered parachute design, in accordance with the metrics below. \r\n\tMonth 4: Preliminary Design Review (PDR).

Present initial test and evaluation plan, hardware purchase plan, and safety plan for Phase II testing.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPerformers may perform lab or bench-scale testing to increase design fidelity as desired, as long as this does not negatively impact the design review schedule. Performers will work with DARPA to identify potential transition partners for demonstrations in Phase II. Performers will present plans to manufacture prototype parachute(s) and test them in Phase II.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase I metrics: Present the design, at a CDR level, of a parachute system that can: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDeliver air to canopy cells, or use other innovative methods, to maintain sustained parachute canopy flight at an altitude of >500 ft. AGL and <3000 ft. AGL (<5000 ft. MSL), \r\n\tDo so for a horizontal flight distance greater than 10 km from the point of engagement, \r\n\tDo so in less than 20 seconds from a manual initiation command, \r\n\tDo so while preserving total mass of the parachute rig (to include a reserve parachute) at <50 kg, \r\n\tIf weight is added to the body of the jumper, add no more than 50 lbs. to the weight of the jumper,\r\n\tBe capable of being engaged while airborne, and disengaged via manual control in order to land as needed, \r\n\tMaintain a forward speed of at least 20 mph, at an altitude of >500 ft. AGL and <3000 ft. AGL (<5000 ft. MSL), \r\n\tDetermine the probability of a successful opening of the prototype, i.e., demonstrate \u201cdo no harm\u201d with the added mechanism(s) to existing opening probability when in a rigger-approved, properly packed configuration.\r\n\tPresent estimates of the noise generated by the system in flight, in decibels (dB),\r\n\tPresent scalability calculations for maximum projected range, with added mass, \r\n\tPresent the proposed cost of the parachute system when produced at scale, as demonstrated via techno-economic analysis of the cost of production, in dollars per parachute rig.\r\n\tSystems may use initiation energy from a parachute dive that increases velocity (e.g., a diving swoop that trades potential energy for kinetic energy), but may not use such methods when at the flight altitude. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nProposers must begin their effort with an experienced, licensed parachute rigger team, with significant practical experience in parachute packing, repair, evaluation, and modification. Additionally, by the end of Phase I, proposers should demonstrate the following:\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\tTo show available expertise for Phase II fabrication of the proposed design: teaming with an existing commercial parachute manufacturer that has sold at least 5,000 airworthy canopy units;\u00a0 \r\n\tTo conduct jump testing in Phase II: teaming with an existing US Parachute Association (USPA) compliant drop zone [1].\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The Phase II effort consists of a base period of 12 months, an Option 1 period of 12 months and an Option 2 period of 12 months. The Option 2 period will follow the Option 1 period. DARPA reserves the right to release a separate Direct to Phase II (DP2) SBIR solicitation in lieu of exercising either Option. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTesting in the base period will center around design, feasibility testing and proof-of-concept. Experimental assessments of ram-air generation, and interaction with parachute cells, may also be necessary to demonstrate a proof of concept. Testing in the option periods will expand the maximum range, reduce noise, and conduct a challenge-based flyoff (Figure 2). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase II fixed payable milestones for this program should include:\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\tBase period: 12 months \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tMonth 4: Bench Testing Review (BTR).

The second challenge will occur at a drop zone of DARPA\u2019s choosing (SOA: state of the art).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Ram-air parachute technology is currently at high technology readiness level and in full-rate production for both military and civilian uses. Multiple commercial and DoD applications are envisioned after the successful demonstration of a powered parachute prototype. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDoD use by Special Operations Command. The ability to use designed systems for silent, low-altitude ingress is expected to have significant ramifications for pararescue jumpers and military special operators. The ability to separate landing zones (LZ) from targets by over 10 km will allow significant freedom to ingress route planning, and place less demand on helicopter aircraft to place themselves in harm\u2019s way to deliver operators to their LZs. \r\n\tCommercial use by US Parachute Association, and other international skydiving entities. Cross-braced canopies has created the sport of parachute swooping, which today boasts national and international championships, and the creation of over 20 distinct parachute designs, each of which has sold over 5,000 units at costs of >$4,000 USD per piece. A safe, powered parachute system is expected to revolutionize modern recreational skydiving and create a significant market for parachutes that can do more than simply land where the wind, and existing kinetic energy, dictate. The products delivered in this effort will create a new sport with significant mass-market attraction, and there is a viable business model from the skydiver audience \u2013 for example, the US Parachute Association alone has over 35,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t[1] USPA Dropzone Locator, United States Parachute Association. https://uspa.org/DZlocator\r\n\t[2] Long Range Precision Aerial Delivery System (LRPADS). https://ombra.us/product/long-range-precision-aerial-delivery-system/\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Systems Level, Handling, Product Design, System\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2464921","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Bright ELectron and Light Sources (BELLS) -  SBIR XL","branch":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","topic_number":"HR0011SB20234XL-03\t","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Biomedical\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The goal of BELLS is to demonstrate and commercialize practical sources of intense, tunable electrons and monochromatic hard x-rays. These sources would support transformative capabilities for applications such as non-destructive inspection, medical diagnostics, and treatments.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: BELLS will develop compact sources of monoenergetic electrons and photons suitable for demonstrating a range of transformative medical and non-destructive inspection applications with the overall goal of defining a minimum viable product (MVP) for commercialization. BELLS contains two subtopics that will be executed in parallel. Subtopic 1 focuses on maturing existing laboratory scale systems to demonstrate application feasibility and further productization. Subtopic 2 seeks to mature specific component technologies to be integrated into Subtopic 1 laboratory-scale systems that provide brightness enhancements enabling additional applications and productization opportunities. \r\nSubtopic 1: Demonstration and Productization. High-quality electron and photon sources are of broad interest for a range of security, industrial, and medical applications. Recent advances in photoinjectors[1], linear accelerators[2], high power lasers[3], and a range of ancillary technologies have resulted in several prototype systems that provide novel, compact testbeds for investigating these applications. However, further maturation and demonstration of these technologies is needed to realize systems with commercialization potential. The purpose of this subtopic is to mature testbed system(s) demonstrating one or more applications and to define minimum viable commercial product(s).  \r\n\r\nHigh-quality electrons produced from photoinjectors and linear accelerators offer utility by themselves as well as the ability to produce bright monoenergetic x-rays through laser-Compton interactions[4]. Controlling the accelerator power allows the energy of electrons and x-rays to be tuned. For x-rays, it is possible to achieve synchrotron-like performance while achieving higher energies (100s of keV to MeV energies) in highly compact form factors.  \r\n\r\nVery high-energy electron beams (100s of MeV) and bright light sources enable a range of applications including, but not limited to: \r\n\u2022\tMedical imaging, including phase contrast \r\n\u2022\tMedical radiotherapy, including FLASH and theranostics \r\n\u2022\tNondestructive test and evaluation, including high resolution tomography and semiconductor metrology.\r\n\r\nThe effort will not just explore the technical applications of these sources, but also the business cases, economic impacts, and regulatory requirements for such technologies to be broadly employed. These studies will support jump-starting medical and industrial activity in this sector, leading to commercially viable system designs.\r\n\r\nSubtopic 2: Brightness Enhancements. Application performance can often be improved with increased source brightness, i.e. intensity and purity. This subtopic seeks to enhance the testbed(s)/prototype(s) of Subtopic 1 by advancing and integrating new component technology. Examples of such technology could include improvements in laser systems, electron systems, spot size reduction strategies, Fabry-Perot cavities, pulse stacking, and pulse recirculation.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: BELLS is a direct to Phase II SBIR XL program only; there is no Phase I. Proposers must provide experimental evidence of their approach concept commensurate to a Phase I effort that achieves significant performance. Specifically, proposers must provide evidence of existing performance in the three technology areas described below: \r\n\u2022\tPhotoinjector \r\no\tC-band or higher frequency \r\no\tSupport microamp or greater average currents \t\r\no\tSupport micropulse structures at RF frequencies at macro system repetition rates of 100 Hz or greater \r\no\t> 10 pC of charge produced per incident laser pulse \r\no\tSupport electron energy of 5 MeV or greater \r\no\tNormalized emittance of 1 \u00b5m or better \r\n\u2022\tElectron accelerator \r\no\tC-band or higher frequency \r\no\tAcceleration gradients 50 MV/m or greater \r\no\tSupport electron energy of 50 MeV or greater \r\no\tSupport 10 micron or smaller laser-Compton interaction spot sizes \r\n\u2022\tInteraction laser \r\no\tSupport 10 micron or smaller laser-Compton interaction spot sizes \r\no\tSufficient energy to support laser-Compton applications generating > 30 keV photons\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Subtopic 1: Demonstrations and Productization  \r\nProposers must apply to Subtopic 1 to be eligible to apply to Subtopic 2. Subtopic 2 will run concurrently with Subtopic 1.    \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this subtopic is to mature existing laboratory scale systems into platforms demonstrating one or more applications, and defining a minimum viable commercial product for supporting those applications.  \r\n\r\nProposers must clearly and quantitatively describe the existing laboratory system that can support laser-Compton x-ray generation. This includes key subsystems such as photoinjector, linear electron accelerator, interaction laser, and precision subsystem synchronization.   \r\n\r\nProposers must also choose at least one application (preferably more) and describe in detail how the existing laboratory scale system can be used to develop and mature a testbed enabling productization. This must include both a technical description and an economic analysis supporting commercial viability of the approach. This analysis must also include participation by one or more relevant stakeholders able to employ this product for the described application(s).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the system must support the performance metrics in the table below for photon production.  \t\r\n\r\n\tParameter\tThreshold\tObjective\r\nIntensity\tIntensity (photons/s)\t> 10^9\t> 10^10\r\n\tRepetition Rate (Hz)\t > 100\t > 1000\r\nEnergy\tMinimum (keV)\t> 100\t> 300\r\nPurity\tBandwidth (dE/E)\t< 10%\t< 0.1%\r\n\r\nHere, \u201cthreshold\u201d indicates the minimum acceptable performance levels while \u201cobjective\u201d levels are highly desired.  \r\n\r\nThe base period will focus on completing a BELLS testbed capable of producing relevant levels of electrons and laser-Compton photons for the chosen application(s). Performers will conduct outreach to customers, stakeholders, industrial partners, and regulators to engage in testbed use.   \r\n\r\nOption period 1 will focus on testbed demonstration and characterization activities, and develop system requirements for a minimum viable product. System characterization supporting the laser-Compton performance metrics above is expected. Option period 2 continues testbed activities while further developing the minimum viable product through a critical design review. Active participation of customers, stakeholders, industrial partners, and regulators (as appropriate) is required throughout both option periods.   \r\n\r\nBase period (6 months) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Kickoff slide deck summarizing technical approach to meet overall goals, risks, and risk mitigations, and quantified milestone schedule  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Testbed build interim report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Testbed build final report  \r\nOption period 1 (6 months) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Testbed demonstration kickoff materials, with stakeholder participation \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Testbed characterization report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Testbed demonstration interim report, MVP system requirements review report  \r\nOption period 2 (6 months) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Testbed stakeholder engagement and transition report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: MVP preliminary design review report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Testbed demonstration final report, MVP critical design review report \r\n\r\nMonthly written technical progress reports will supplement the above milestones (see template under SBIR/STTR BAA DOCUMENTS at https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/for-small-businesses/participate-sbir-sttr-program). \r\n\r\nSubtopic 2: Brightness Enhancements  \r\nProposers can propose to Subtopic 2 within their Subtopic 1 proposal.\r\nThis subtopic seeks to enhance the testbed(s) of subtopic 1 by advancing and integrating component technology \u2013 specifically, laser-Compton performance to improve brightness, supporting commercially-relevant applications.   \r\n\r\nProposers must clearly describe the new component technology and anticipated testbed performance increases. Increases in performance must enable an additional application or improve the commercial prospects of the minimum viable product.   \r\n\r\nDevelopment timelines must align to integration into the testbed by the end of the option period 1.  \r\nThe Base period will focus on developing component technology to enhance brightness. During the option period 1, components will be refined and integrated into the testbed. During the option period 2, the enhanced testbed will be tested to verify performance, assess improvements in testbed capabilities, and enable further minimum viable product definition.  \r\n\r\nBase period (6 months) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Kickoff slide deck summarizing technical approach to meet overall goals, risks, and risk mitigations, and quantified milestone schedule  \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Testbed enhancement preliminary design review report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Testbed enhancement critical design review report  \r\nOption period 1 (6 months) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Testbed enhancement integration readiness report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Testbed enhancement interim report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Testbed enhancement final report  \r\nOption period 2 (6 months) milestones: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Enhanced testbed stakeholder engagement and transition report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Enhanced testbed characterization report \r\n\u2022\tMonth 6: Final system performance report  \r\n\r\nMonthly written technical progress reports will supplement the above milestones (see template under SBIR/STTR BAA DOCUMENTS at https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/for-small-businesses/participate-sbir-sttr-program).\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The successful development of such electron and x-ray sources supports a range of medical and non-destructive inspection applications. These include microbeam radiation diagnostic procedures, FLASH e-beam/x-ray radiotherapy, and innovations in theranostics. These sources would also be of high interest to the semiconductor industry for nanometrology and in-line inspection at semiconductor foundries, to include fraud detection.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful proposals for this SBIR offering must make significant arguments supporting the commercial viability of their approach. Hence, proposals must provide initial evidence that their laboratory scale systems have sufficient technical maturity and performance characteristics that would support economically viable applications with development into a minimally viable product. Proposals for Subtopic 2 must make arguments that the proposed enhancement(s) could significantly advance the economics of productization of their system concepts. Transition and commercialization (T-C) milestones have been added as part of the option periods to aid in assuring commercial viability\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tPerformance of a second generation X-band rf photoinjector, Marsh et al., Phys.

The prototype should include fabricated hardware integrated into a commercially available parachute rig, and should support repacking on a fast timeline (<60 seconds), with the addition of no more than 20% of the mass of the parachute rig. Proposers should include any testing capabilities needed to verify that the modified canopy is in an airworthy (jumpable) configuration, without significant impact to the probability of a successful opening.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Parachutes are used by the Department of Defense in ejection seats (e.g., the F-16 ACES II system), for special operations ingress, and advance airdrop (Figure 1).\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf ejecting behind enemy lines becomes necessary, particularly in time-critical scenarios, a large open canopy on the ground can be an indicator to the location of downed aircrew. The ability to trigger an automated repack of this parachute, without impacting its airworthiness and probability of successful opening, is desired. Special operators plan parachute ingress routes to allow sufficient distance from the target to land and manually pack the parachute. The ability to trigger a time-critical repack to minimize ground footprint could significantly change route planning and allow a landing closer to a target for maximum impact. Finally, logistics airdrops from an airborne platform are capable of delivering large amounts of mass to areas of engagement, but leave a large footprint; the ability to minimize this footprint to support special operations is also of interest to the Department of Defense.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

The Option 2 period will follow the Option 1 period. Testing in the base and Option 1 periods will be conducted on ram-air canopies, to preserve maximum aerodynamic flexibility. Testing in the Option 2 period will be conducted on round canopies, and evaluate the jumpability (defined here as the probability of a successful parachute opening, with the addition of the repacking mechanism) of repacked ram-air parachutes.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn this effort, proposers will design and develop a jumpable, repackable parachute prototype that will: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tRepack an opened parachute into its container using electromagnetic, mechanical or other mechanisms, Do so in less than 60 seconds from a manual initiation command, \r\n\tDo so while adding less than 20% mass to an existing commercially available parachute rig, \r\n\tDetermine the probability of a successful opening of the prototype before automated repacking, i.e., demonstrate that the added repacking mechanism \u201cdoes no harm\u201d to existing opening probability when in a rigger-approved, properly packed configuration, \r\n\tCharacterize the probability of a successful opening of the prototype after automated repacking, toward potential future commercialization opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is expected that designed repackable parachutes will need to be test jumped in order to support the goals of this effort. Proposers should describe their ability to work with parachute test jumpers, at appropriate drop zones, in order to accomplish statistical significance on the probability of a successful parachute opening with added repacking mechanisms. The wide number of commercially available parachuting rigs for recreational skydiving, and the high reliability of belly-mounted and rig-mounted reserve parachutes, allow for a rapid cycle of design-test-fly-redesign that proposers should plan to leverage. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe minimum deliverable will be an airworthy, repackable proof-of-concept parachute prototype in a complete rig (i.e., with a container, main and reserve parachute, and other accompanying hardware). \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase II fixed payable milestones for this program should include:\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBase period (required): 12 months \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonth 2: Concept Design Review (CoDR) on repackable parachute design, with hardware purchase plan and initial test and evaluation plan; \r\n\tMonth 6: Bench Testing Review (BTR).

Proposals must focus on difficult to source, long lead time components that control system efficiency and lifetime; in particular, high-performance components used in the hot gas path of power and propulsion turbines. This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Department of Defense (DoD) faces technical and procurement challenges with hot-section components in turbines (e.g., blades, vanes, seals, etc.) across various ground and aerospace platforms. These components operate in high temperature oxidizing environments while under extreme mechanical loads, requiring specialized materials and manufacturing techniques. Traditionally, these hot-section components are produced by casting nickel-based superalloys using a directional or single crystal solidification approach. These specialized casting techniques are costly and time-consuming, resulting in part replacement lead times averaging 18 to 36 months due to the highly specialized knowledge and equipment required to produce parts.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of ACE3 is to reduce critical hot-section turbine part lead times by exploiting the supply chain advantages of additive manufacturing (AM).. Melt-based AM of nickel-based superalloys offers advantages in precision, reduced scrappage, enhanced design freedom, shorter lead times, and a potential reduction in manufacturing costs compared to conventional directional or single crystal casting operations. However, AM techniques typically impart a fine grain size (e.g., 10-100 \u00b5m), resulting in inferior high-temperature creep properties compared to those of directionally solidified or single crystal materials [1]. Therefore, while additively manufactured blades and vanes are extremely attractive for next-generation engine designs and sustainment of DoD\u2019s existing fleet, implementation is inhibited by poor high-temperature mechanical properties. To address this issue, the ACE3 project seeks to demonstrate new post-processing technologies that dramatically enhance the high-temperature mechanical behavior of hollow core or net-shaped nickel-based superalloys fabricated with laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) by transforming the as-built components from fine (<100 \u00b5m) grain structure to coarse (>1 mm) grain structure, resulting in creep performance improvement by at least an order-of-magnitude. Electron beam additive manufacturing is specifically not of interest due to inherent issues with short filament lifetimes and de-powdering of hollow core structures.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nProposals must include: (1) an effective strategy for addressing difficult to source, long lead time components that control efficiency and lifetime in the hot gas path of turbine engines; (2) the proposer\u2019s familiarity with turbine design including the basic functional and design requirements of hot-section components; and (3) alloy(s) of interest to be tested and a relevant component design to evaluate the proposed post-processing strategy. Proposals are not limited to current component designs \u2013 novel designs uniquely enabled through additive manufacturing are encouraged.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is soliciting Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals only. Previous efforts must have demonstrated a post-processing approach capable of achieving the milestones and metrics listed below supported by prior laboratory testing results:\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDemonstrated ability to perform post-processing on a commercially relevant nickel-based superalloy additively manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), such as Inconel 738LC (IN738LC). \r\n\tDemonstrated at least 10x increase in grain size relative to the as-built material along the build direction following post-processing. \r\n\tDemonstrated the ability to retain at least 20% (area fraction) <100> cube texture in the build direction following post-processing. \r\n\tDemonstrated the ability to control grain structure as a function of position within a test article with cm-scale precision\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The ACE3 DP2 project seeks to build on the accomplishments listed in the Phase I section above to: (1) fully characterize the high-temperature mechanical properties of additively manufactured superalloy test specimens with and without the demonstrated post-processing strategy; (2) apply the validated post-processing strategy to an exemplary component design fabricated by LPBF; and (3) confirm the structure and properties match those expected from baseline coupon-level testing while also demonstrating the ability to successfully process components at scale with a scrap rate <5%. Final components must be subject to proof testing in a relevant environment to verify functional performance (TRL 6). Performers must bring their own exemplar design and propose a component-level test strategy sufficient for TRL 6 justification. The Phase II effort will consist of a 12-month base period with a 12-month option period. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: Phase II fixed milestones for this program must include: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonth 1: Project kickoff meeting; all supporting positions identified in the proposal are assigned to personnel and names are provided to the Government. \r\n\tMonth 3: Preliminary high-temperature mechanical test results on additively manufactured superalloy coupons in as-built and post-processed conditions using the proposed strategy.

However, strict requirements for classified program execution inhibits these new small businesses from immediately performing on programs. The major inhibitors are cost (monetary and time) and process (convoluted based on sponsor, location, and accreditor). Significant resources can be sunk into the Secure Area/Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF)/Special Access Program Facility (SAPF) construction and accreditation process with no guarantees that the completed area would actually be usable. Several businesses have emerged that specialize in constructing such facilities, but offer their expertise as a significant markup that is cost prohibitive for small businesses. Existing research into Language Models (LMs) has been done to provide a means to both fill in the blanks within sentences based on context clues and automate an interactive knowledge base from a knowledge corpus. Additional research has leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) for monitoring construction progress, comparing completed construction to initial designs, and identifying materials from construction images.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) topic is seeking technologies for automating, scaling, updating, and simplifying the process for applying, designing, constructing, and validating Secure Areas/SCIFs/SAPFs. Prospero performers will explore approaches and develop prototypes for automating paperwork, designing secure rooms, and overseeing construction. Prospero is interested in software tools that can be utilized by non-security personnel at all steps of the design and accreditation process that can also be offered at a minimal cost to the end-user.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Performers will develop approaches for utilizing AI, Machine Learning (ML), and LMs to automate, update, and improve secure facility design, paperwork, oversight, and validation. Prospero prototypes should be able to demonstrate the ability to automate the paperwork processes, reduce the barrier to entry for secure facility design, and streamline the process for overseeing facility construction.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe program seeks breakthrough approaches to various technical challenges, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDeveloping efficient models and techniques for automating accreditation paperwork\r\n\tDeveloping efficient algorithms and techniques for monitoring secure facility construction to meet auditing requirements\r\n\tDeveloping tools for non-experts to be able to fulfill accreditation reporting requirements\r\n\tUnderstanding the accreditation process across multiple sponsors\r\n\tStreamlining disparate sponsor requirements into a single knowledge base\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II (DP2) solicitation. Therefore, Phase I proposals will not be accepted or reviewed. Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed feasibility study or a basic prototype system; definition and characterization of properties desirable for both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian use; and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methodologies (competing approaches). This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have application to the core objective of automating the design, submission, and validation of secure facilities. Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above have been met and describe the potential military or commercial applications. DP2 documentation should include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\ttechnical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, and risks/mitigations, assessments;\r\n\tpresentation materials and/or white papers;\r\n\ttechnical papers;\r\n\tprototype designs/models;\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration. DP2 proposers must also demonstrate knowledge, skills, and ability in computer science, physical security, electrical engineering, and software engineering. For detailed information on DP2 requirements and eligibility, please refer to the DoD BAA and the DARPA Instructions for this topic.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The goal of Prospero is to design and evaluate tools and techniques for automating and streamlining secure facility design, construction, and accreditation. Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed prototype system. These activities should focus specifically on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEvaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives\r\n\tDescribing in detail how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve DOD need(s) as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale across additional sponsors.\r\n\tIdentifying the proposed solution&#39;s clear transition path considering input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, security, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber.\r\n\tSpecifying the solution&#39;s integration with other current and potential future solutions.\r\n\tDescribing the solution&#39;s sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or Governmental customers for the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase II will culminate in a system demonstration using one or more compelling use cases consistent with commercial opportunities, DOD opportunities, and/or insertion into a DARPA program. The below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results for the Phase II effort.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables:\r\n\r\nProposers will execute Research and Development (R&D) plan as described in their proposal. Proposers will also complete a commercialization plan that addresses relevant material costs and potential material/equipment suppliers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonth 1: Phase II Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) (in person or virtual, as needed) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, proposed metrics, and plan for prototype demonstration/validation.\r\n\tMonths 2, 4: Technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this will normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\tMonth 6: Interim technical progress briefing (live system demo with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM (in-person or virtual as needed) detailing progress made (include quantitative assessment of capability developed to date), tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, planned activities, and technical plan for the remainder of Phase II, the demonstration/verification plan for the end of Phase II, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\tMonth 9, 12, 15: Quarterly technical progress reports detailing technical progress made, tasks accomplished, major risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (with necessary updates as in the parenthetical remark for Months 2 and 4), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM.\r\n\tMonth 18/Final Phase II Deliverables: Final demonstration with documented details, demonstrating accreditation paperwork automation; demonstrating automated SCIF/SAPF design for multiple sponsors; demonstrating construction oversight that meets auditing requirements; any other necessary documentation (including, at a minimum, user manuals and a detailed system design document; and the end of phase commercialization plan).\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III work will be oriented towards transition and commercialization of the developed Prospero technologies. The proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype software into a viable product or non-R&D service for sale in military or private sector markets. Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrimary Prospero support will be to national efforts for growing the DIB and improving secure facility construction processes. Such technology can be used to enable any small business to construct secure facilities while minimizing the risks associated with the current processes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDonahue, Chris, Mina Lee, and Percy Liang. \"Enabling language models to fill in the blanks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.05339 (2020).\r\n\tGil, Daeyoung, Ghang Lee, and Kahyun Jeon. \"Classification of images from construction sites using a deep-learning algorithm.\" ISARC.

Critical infrastructure is among the worst affected; most vulnerabilities within these systems go unidentified, and a majority of the identified vulnerabilities have no patch or mitigation [3]. This state of affairs presents a serious threat to U.S. national security.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nToday, manual vulnerability discovery and remediation requires subject matter experts (SME) who can identify and investigate vulnerabilities within software and develop fixes for them. Beginning with the invention of fuzz testing in 1988 [4], the development of tools and techniques for automatic vulnerability discovery and remediation (AVD&R) has continued to move forward toward systems that implement logical reasoning and program analysis approaches to identify and characterize software vulnerabilities.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nRecent advancements in AI and ML, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have potential to push AVD&R beyond the inherent barriers of today\u2019s logical reasoning systems. By leveraging their symbolic abstractions, neural networks and deep learning techniques can be harnessed to reduce false positives and produce more precise tooling, significantly reducing human intervention. A neuro-symbolic approach could learn novel vulnerability patterns, moving far beyond the capabilities of current tools. Further, by leveraging ML to generate code, patches can be generated automatically at scale. LLMs, have shown enormous potential for reasoning over software, and provide a strong foundation for innovation in AVD&R. Automatic code generation tools, such as CodePilot [5], have been able to write parts of software with little human-intervention. Further, ChatGPT [6] [7] has been shown to be able to accurately find, characterize, and fix certain vulnerabilities. LLMs will also enable new approaches to computer-human teaming for AVD&R, ameliorating the friction found in current tools that prevents their widespread use. [7] \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of AIxCC is to facilitate innovation at the intersection of AVD&R and AI to secure widely used code that underpins critical infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This is a Direct to Phase II (DP2) solicitation. Therefore, Phase I proposals will not be accepted or reviewed. Phase I feasibility will be demonstrated through evidence of: a completed feasibility study or a basic prototype system; definition and characterization of properties desirable for both Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian use; and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art methodologies (competing approaches). This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have application to the core objective of developing a framework for scalable and automated discovery of vulnerabilities in arbitrary complex systems. Proposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above have been met and describe the potential military or commercial applications. DP2 documentation should include: \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 technical reports describing results and conclusions of existing work, particularly regarding the commercial opportunity or DoD insertion opportunity, and risks/mitigations, assessments; \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 presentation materials and/or white papers; \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 technical papers;\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 test and measurement data; \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 prototype designs/models; \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 performance projections, goals, or results in different use cases. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis collection of material will verify mastery of the required content for DP2 consideration.

These open-source systems should be well documented and tested against a suit of tests to determine efficacy.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDP2 proposals should:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tdescribe a proposed system to achieve the aforementioned goals and \r\n\tpresent a technical plan and approach, with notable risks/mitigations.\u00a0 \r\n\tprovide an proposed plan to open-source the system under an Open Source Inititative (OSI) approved license.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase II will include a test and evaluation event where the system must demonstrate its efficacy against a set of AVD&R challenges.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA Phase II Option period will further mature AIxCC systems to expand applications to additional technology transition and prototype activities for the DoD, another Federal agency, or the private sector. The Phase II Option will be contingent on results from a test and evaluation of the final Phase II prototype system. All Phase II Option matured prototypes must be open-sourced with appropriate licensing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe below schedule of milestones and deliverables is provided to establish expectations and desired results/end products for the Phase II and Phase II Option period efforts.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables: \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nProposers will execute a Research and Development (R&D) plan as described in their proposal including the following fixed payable milestones for this program:\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Month 1: Phase II Kickoff briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA Program Manager (PM) including: any updates to the proposed plan and technical approach, risks/mitigations, schedule (inclusive of dependencies) with planned capability milestones and deliverables, and plan for prototype. \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Month 3: Technical progress report detailing technical progress to date, tasks accomplished, risks/mitigations, a technical plan for the remainder of Phase II (while this would normally report progress against the plan detailed in the proposal or presented at the Kickoff briefing, it is understood that scientific discoveries, competition, and regulatory changes may all have impacts on the planned work and DARPA must be made aware of any revisions that result), planned activities, trip summaries, and any potential issues or problem areas that require the attention of the DARPA PM. \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Month 6: Test and evaluation of final prototype via participation in an AIxCC competition event.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Month 9: Final technical progress briefing (with annotated slides) to the DARPA PM.

The military\u2019s current ability to respond to slow-moving, high-altitude objects is constrained by physics and the capabilities of current weapons systems. For example, the F-22 is one of few aircraft able to operate at an altitude above 50,000 feet. Additionally, these aircraft travel at hundreds of miles per hour while attempting to identify and target slow-moving or stationary objects. Aerial systems of interest are typically downed in areas of lower risk to humans. These constraints, coupled with current technical capabilities, result in limited engagement opportunities and difficult recovery operations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe DARPA CAPTURE effort seeks to rapidly develop and demonstrate an integrated prototype system to capture and retrieve aerial systems of interest flying slowly at high altitudes under positive control in a manner safe to the surrounding area while maximizing exploitation of the captured system.

Solutions should clearly identify what existing technologies or systems would be used as part of the approach. Examples may include, but are not limited to, involvement of specific slow-moving aircraft or use of surface-based systems. Solutions requiring additional government furnished information, dependencies, or equipment to be potentially provided as part of the solution should be clearly and plainly described for consideration of the proposed approach.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is Direct to Phase II only. The desired system may leverage existing technologies and systems to rapidly integrate into a prototype system in order to demonstrate the desired objective capability.

A follow-on option phase should include a final demonstration no more than 9 to 12 months after contract award. This timeline emphasizes the desire for innovative yet simple development of readily available capabilities. The prototype system may use or modify existing technologies and operational systems (military or commercial) to rapidly achieve program objectives.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe performer will be expected to provide a Statement of Work (SOW) listing tasks and associated subtasks required to meet the following deliverables commensurate within the stated timeline for this effort: \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Description and analysis of the concept of employment\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Description and analysis of the concept of operations\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 System concept and designs to include any modification of existing designs\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technical, cost, and schedule risk analysis of the proposed approach \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anticipated risk reduction testing plan and schedule \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Final prototype system hardware, software, and technical data packages\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Field test demonstration\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe performer must identify what government information and assets must be made available as part of the development process and system testing (GFI and GFE).

Follow-on options to the base effort are expected to include the rapid incorporation into the operational systems and organizations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Transition partners will be integral to the execution during the Phase II effort due to the rapid and inherent utilization of operational assets requirements.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\thttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/02/16/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-states-response-to-recent-aerial-objects/\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\thttps://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3297104/chinese-surveillance-balloons-global-in-scope-says-official/\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS: Manned/unmanned air vehicles; missiles; air capture/retrieval systems\r\n","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2464973","subtopics":[]},{"topic_title":"Anti-Shock Drug, Pre-Hospital (ASD-PH)","branch":"Defense Health Agency","topic_number":"DHA234-D001","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Combat Casualty Care\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Develop a drug that would be useful in a pre-hospital setting for treatment of hemorrhagic shock in humans.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Severe blood loss, such as may be experienced in combat or other settings, if left untreated, will result in a deficiency of oxygen that will lead to the death of cells, tissues, and organs, and ultimately death. A pharmaceutical solution is required to address, in a pre-hospital setting, this life-threatening situation. The desired benefits of the drug are that its administration would increase the probability of survival, reduce the need for other treatment products, and reduce the need for prompt medical evacuation. The following characteristics are considered desirable: (1) The drug would most likely be administered promptly after injury, before blood or blood components are administered; however, a drug that would be administered as a pre-treatment, prior to injury, would also be of interest. (2) The drug would be administered in a low volume, perhaps 5 to 20 milliliters, to minimize the burden of transporting it and administering it. (3) The drug would be stable (retain its effectiveness) for at least one year over a broad temperature range such as 2 to 40 degrees Celsius. (4) The drug would be amenable to administration by several routes, such as oral, intravenous, intraosseous, inhalation, and intramuscular.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: DoD seeks the identification of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), administration of which will provide effective treatment of shock in a pre-hospital setting. The performer will determine the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of such an API. Upon conclusion of Phase I, the performer will have: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tIdentified a concept for the mechanism of action for the API.\r\n\u2022\tAscertained key elements (chemical moieties) of the API.\r\n\u2022\tProduced a candidate formulation, for one or more routes of administration, for the API.\r\n\u2022\tPerformed a detailed analysis of predicted performance (safety and efficacy) of the API as formulated for administration.\r\n\u2022\tDefined key technological milestones for development of the API into a drug approvable bythe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use.\r\n\u2022\tDemonstrated the feasibility of analyzing the safety and efficacy of the API when formulatedfor administration and outlined the criteria for success. \r\n\r\nThis topic is accepting Direct to Phase II (DPII) proposals ONLY. Proposers submitting a DPII proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described above has been met and describes the potential commercial applications.\r\n\r\nDocumentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to, technical reports, test data, and performance goals/results.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: The expectations and required deliverables for Phase II work are: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tUsing results from Phase I, produce a batch of candidate ASD-PH formulated foradministration to one or more vertebrate species as part of pre-clinical testing.\r\n\u2022\tTest a candidate ASD-PH for efficacy in a suitable animal model. The animal model mustinvolve blood loss that, untreated, would reproducibly lead to death of most test subjectsfrom shock within approximately 60 minutes after blood loss.\r\n\u2022\tPrepare a Product Development Plan and seek comments from the FDA on its acceptability.\r\n\u2022\tManufacture a batch of candidate ASD-PH suitable for pre-clinical testing of safety under Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs).\r\n\u2022\tPerform Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies.\r\n\u2022\tUpdate/revise the Product Development Plan to take into account the results of pre-clinicaltesting and FDA advice.\r\n\u2022\tDeliver a Technical Data Package containing submissions to the FDA, communications fromthe FDA, and the Product Development Plan.\r\n\u2022\tUpon request by the Government sponsor, deliver a sample of candidate ASD-PH to the Government for retention and/or analyses at no cost to the performer. The quantity of sample delivered to the Government will not be so great as to interfere with the performer\u2019s plans for development.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Phase III will culminate in an FDA-approved treatment for shock suitable for use in role 1 of military health care and in similar non-military austere settings such remote areas where paramedics and other personnel provide emergency medical treatment. It will be the logical conclusion of product development conducted in phases I and II. Phase III work will include the engagement of relevant stakeholders within DoD to ensure that product labeling and packaging are accomplished with due consideration of military operational requirements and logistical support.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\tCampion EM, Pritts TA, Dorlac WC, Nguyen AQ, Fraley SM, Hanseman D, Robinson BR.Implementation of a military-derived damage-control resuscitation strategy in a civiliantrauma center decreases acute hypoxia in massively transfused patients.

This award will seek offerors to engage the FDA, conduct Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) animal studies, and deliver prototype devices to the government.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Ocular injuries are common occurrences among warfighters, occurring disproportionately compared to injuries affecting more protected areas of the body. The cornea is the first tissue of the ocular structure and often impacted first in trauma. Combat corneal injuries often have a significant impact on vision and there can be significant delays in receiving specialty care for combat ocular trauma. In recent combat operations corneal puncture injuries resulted in poor visual outcomes often resulting in blindness.  This is predominantly due to inadequate battlefield interventions to close the open ocular wounds and restore intraocular pressure. A study published in 2020 describes the cause and type of ocular injuries in modern warfare and analyzed all patients with eye injuries from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts who were treated at Military Treatment Facilities (MTF).  They reported 67,586 persons were admitted to either a United States or United Kingdom MTF for treatment of injuries. 8-10% of wounded soldiers had ocular injuries. 82% of those injuries occurred in battle and 71% were from explosions, and 56% had open globe injuries. [1]\r\n\t\r\nIf an open globe (OG) injury is suspected on the battlefield, a rigid eye shield is applied to protect the eye, and the injured warfighter is evacuated to an ophthalmic specialist. Then, OG injuries are closed with sutures to create a watertight seal. This may occur up to 24 hr post-injury currently and is expected to increase up to 72 hr in future combat operations where air evacuation may not be guaranteed. [2-4] However, 53% of OG injured eyes retain intraocular foreign body upon injury and require evacuation to an ophthalmic specialist for surgical intervention. [5] \r\n\r\nIn order to address corneal and corneoscleral injuries earlier and in a way that is relevant to the\r\nthe austerity encountered in a TO, a product that allows for temporary stabilization of corneal and corneoscleral injuries is needed. The temporary cornea repair (TCR) will serve as a bridge management strategy that will remain in place until more definitive care is available.  The TCR capability will be in support of MTFs associated with the Military Healthcare System at Role of Care (RoC) 2 (Forward Resuscitative Surgical Team) and RoC 3 (Combat Support Hospital). For a description of RoC please see the reference section.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, the offeror shall provide detail and documentation which demonstrates the accomplishment of a \"Phase I-like\" effort, including a feasibility study. This includes, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit of a non-surgical prototype that will temporarily stabilize suspected full thickness corneal and corneoscleral injuries. Feasibility documentation of particular interest is prior evidence leading to: \r\n\u2022\tPreliminary data to support the safety and efficacy of the prototype. \r\n\u2022\tDesign specifications for the prototype.\r\n\u2022\tGLP-biocompatibility (in vitro and in vivo) safety validation data if available.\r\n\u2022\tStatistically significant performance data if available.\r\n\r\nPHASE II: This phase will focus on refinement and optimization of a non-surgical prototype that will temporarily stabilize suspected full thickness corneal and corneoscleral injuries and can be tested in a military relevant environment.\r\n\r\nOfferors should propose technology solutions ranging from initial testing of design concepts and evaluation of candidate(s) where study endpoints are defined, and animal models are proposed. ((Technology Readiness level (TRL) 3)) to component validation in a non-GLP laboratory environment to refine hypothesis and identify relevant statistical data required for further technological assessment (TRL 4). Further information regarding DOD Biomedical TRLs can be found in the reference section.\r\n\r\nThe work may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: \r\n\u2022\tPrototype refinement/maturation progressing towards clinical product\r\n\u2022\tPreclinical studies (as needed) to support an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) (or\r\n\u2022\tother appropriate FDA) submission\r\n\u2022\tPreclinical studies under GLP (as needed) to support IDE (or other appropriate FDA) submission\r\n\u2022\tIDE (or other appropriate FDA) submission\r\n\u2022\tStability and shelf-life studies if performed\r\n\u2022\tEstablishment of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) planning for clinical trials and for market release\r\n\u2022\tThe performer is expected deliver up to 4 prototypes for military relevant testing. \r\n\r\nThe desired prototype should be simple enough for medical personnel to administer in a TO with minimal additional training, safe enough to use on any suspected corneal or corneoscleral injuries, capable of maintaining a tight seal for an extended period during transport, and effective at stabilizing the eye such that it preserves eyesight.\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The goal for this Phase is to further development and testing of the prototype through commercialization and FDA approval for its intended use as a temporary stabilization of corneal and corneoscleral injuries. The temporary cornea repair would need to serve as a bridge management strategy that will remain in place until more definitive care is available. Military uses of this technology would support RoC 2 and 3, as well as a mass casualty event where casualties greatly overwhelm first responders and patients need to be triaged to preserve life, limb, and sight.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n1.\t[1] Breeze J, Blanch RJ, Mazzoli R, DuBose J, Bowley DM, Powers DB.

For example, satellite communications (SATCOM ), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)\u00a0 receivers require reference clocks that have high frequency stability, low phase noise and low power operations.\u00a0 Additional applications related to fuzing and other high acceleration applications require the clock generators for microelectronics to be survivable and operational under high G environments. Harshness of military environments and application of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) oscillators is well documented\u00a0 [1]. Clock oscillators that can deliver high performance (50-100ppb frequency stability over operating temperatures, 1E-11 ADEV), low power, in system programming capability in the range of 1-105MHz are required. The oscillators should be operable under 30kG and survivable under 100kG shocks.

Further automatization is envisioned to extract, purify, and isolate the genomic library for use in sequencing using the minION. Successful development of this tool will provide benefits to both government and commercial users of the minION sequencing capability by decreasing both the operator load and potential error in the preparation of biological samples.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Biological Warfare Agent (BWA) detection and identification options for tactical users are limited in both the available technologies and scope of the ID capability. Lab-based theater confirmatory DNA and RNA sequencing are possible, but are not technically or tactically feasible for operators at the current time. Additionally, the methods employed by operators, Hand Held Assay (HHA) and Polymerase Chain Reaction-based (PCR) tools, are definitively limited to known and specifically targeted BWAs. Sequencing, however, is capable of having a BWA library that is only limited by available processing power and available genomic data. The specific need for these users is a tool that can streamline the library preparation of low complexity, high biomass BWA samples for use in a minION in a time-constrained tactical environment. BWA library preparation includes the extraction and purification of the genomic sequence along with the fragmentation of the DNA and attachment of the adaptor protein. When combined with the Oxford Nanopores minION, on-target sequencing results will be viewable in real-time by CONUS/OCONUS laboratories, and decision-makers at the Joint Operations Center (JOC). Applying automated library preparation will prevent potential errors by employed operators, while minimizing the overall time commitment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRequirements for this development are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tool Capabilities :\r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Isolate DNA/RNA from low complexity, high biomass BWA sample \r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Isolation of DNA/RNA must work on all types (i.e. bacteria, viruses, etc.) of BWA samples \r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All steps must be automated, with the exception of the insertion of the raw sample. \r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production of\u00a0 DNA/RNA library must be compatible with Oxford Nanopores minION\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tool Design\r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Approximate Run Time (from insertion of raw sample): <= 10 minutes \r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Approximate Overall Dimensions: 6\u201d x 6\u201d x 3\u201d \r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weight = <5.0 lbs.\r\n\r\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Capable of running isolated or using a windows laptop with GUI software \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Begin with a market research study of potential COTS hardware solutions that meet tool requirements.

chemical synthesis or biosynthetic pathways of publicly available scientific publications that may pose dual-use research of concern (DURC).\u00a0 This topic seeks development of (1) computational methods for employing large language models (LLMs) for automated production of knowledge ontologies from scientific literature and (2) a scalable system with automated annotation

information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, materiel, national security, among other sectors.\u00a0 Automated, large-scale extraction of procedures for chemical synthesis or biosynthesis will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of analysts seeking to provide timely courses

described in United States (U.S.) and European commercial patents (Reference 2).\u00a0 The SynKB system enables chemists to perform structured queries over large corpora of synthesis procedures.\u00a0 Other research groups have applied language models for molecular design, whereby the model implicitly learns the \u201cvocabulary\u201d and composition of valid molecules and provides the ability to survey optimized molecular properties (Reference 3).\u00a0 Text-like representations of chemical reactions (SMILES) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural network Transformer architectures have been applied to retrosynthesis prediction problems (Reference 4).\u00a0 Another research team has developed the AiZynthTrain package for training synthesis models on USPTO patent data with the intent to integrate into retrosynthesis software (Reference 5).\u00a0 This topic seeks to build upon these and similar NLP-based approaches for knowledge extraction that may be broadly applied to chemical or

A filter\u2019s efficiency is rated as a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV), which measures a filter&#39;s ability to capture particles between 0.3 and 10 microns (\u00b5m).

A high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter can remove 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 Micron. An MPPS of 0.2 to 0.3 microns is difficult; many filters are effective at capturing particles smaller or larger than this, but 0.2 to 0.3 micron particles regularly gets by basic filtration. Using 0.3 microns as the MPPS measures the worst-case efficacy of the filter.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe fact that collection efficiency of 0.2 to 0.3 microns particles is worse than for smaller particles might seem counterintuitive, however the combined effect of the various filter collection mechanisms (interception, intertial effect, diffusion effect, gravitational effect, and electrostatic effect) as they relate to particles size causes a dip in the collection efficiency in the 0.2 to 0.3 micron \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUltrasonic sound can cause submicron particles to agglomerate and larger particles to disassociate. Literature varies with respect to the effectiveness; one study\u00a0 showed that mean particle size increased from sub-micron to five micron, and another study\u00a0 reduced the number concentration of micron & \r\n\r\nsub-micron by seventy and thirty percent respectively. Ultrasonic agglomeration studies, might not be comparable as the number and positioning of sound transducers, sound energy and frequency, shape and turbulence of the collection piping and chamber, humidity, etc./, varied from study to study. These \r\n\r\nvariables have an effect on agglomeration effectiveness, however, in every study ultrasonic agglomeration increases particle size distribution from sub-micron to micron or greater. Collection efficiency greatly increases when particle size becomes 3 micron or greater. Furthermore, when \r\n\r\ncombined with other collection mechanisms such as electrostatic charging\u00a0 or the addition of humidity or water droplets\u00a0 the collection efficiency may be substantially increased from any mechanisms acting alone. Successful application of this technology to the future RASA 2.0 system would allow for greater collection efficiency, reducing the Minimum Detectable Concentration (MDC) of targeted Radionuclides and improving the detection likelihood of a clandestine nuclear test.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Conduct extensive document research to determine state of the art with respect to aerosol collection via acoustic agglomeration aided with electrostatic charging and agglomerates such as water droplets. Design and model a system that could interface with the RASA 2.0 intake system for particle collection. Conduct trade-off studies for the system.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Based on the knowledge and determination of feasibility obtained in Phase I, construct a working prototype of the system designed in Phase I.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Provision of an aerosol agglomeration system that could interface with other aerosol collection or air purification systems such as the Senya Snow White.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tde Sarabia E, Gallego-Jua\u00c2rez JA.

Solutions should support data, voice, video, IoT (Internet of Things) and machine to machine-based applications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) for Research and Engineering (R&E) FutureG initiative seeks RF coverage solutions for challenging dynamic interior spaces such as warehouses, supply vessels, and hanger bays. \u00a0Common characteristics of these spaces include dense interiors with metal dividers and barriers.\u00a0 Further, these spaces may be frequently reconfigured, creating new RF environments and new propagation challenges.\u00a0 For example, a previously empty of area of a warehouse, ship hold, or hanger may be loaded with pallets of dense material. \u00a0Later those pallets are distributed, returning that to an empty space.\u00a0 Providing coverage in these types of spaces will require unique solutions to ensure that the RF propagation supports performance requirements such as throughput, latency, and reliability.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSuccessful deployment solutions should provide high network capacity in small areas while minimizing compromises in latency, reliability, and overall performance. \u00a0This topic does not seek a specific fixed network capacity, but instead seeks a solution that anticipates demands for network capacity in these areas will vary over time.\u00a0 Building on the example above, an empty region will typically include few (if any) devices, change from empty to hundreds of devices as pallets of dense materials are moved to the area, and then decrease down to tens of devices as those pallets are distributed. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSuccessful solutions will be assessed by focusing on four (4) metrics.\u00a0 Metric One (1) is the ability to support dynamic changes in network density, as measured by number of active devices that can be supported in a small region of the interior space. \u00a0Preferred solutions will allow large changes in network density. \u00a0Metric two (2) is ability to minimize changes in overall performance (such as latency and reliability) as the network density changes. \u00a0Preferred solutions will have minimal changes in overall performance as density increases.\u00a0 Metric three (3) measures the overall cost of deployment, including both installation/capital expense (CAPEX) costs and operating expense (OPEX) costs. \u00a0Metric four (4) measures the complexity of initial configuration and ongoing operations.\u00a0 An example of a complexity metric would be how many manual tasks are reduced or eliminated by automation or potential numbers of tasks that are handled by AI (Artificial Intelligence).\u00a0 Metrics are a key/critical tool in evaluating the overall effectiveness of a proposal&#39;s implementation.\u00a0 Low metrics with a solid get-well plan are as good as high metrics.\u00a0 No solution is ever perfect.\u00a0 The general metrics described here should be expanded into more granular metrics during the development of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis topic does not require a specific technical approach.\u00a0 However, two approaches are discussed for illustrative purposes. \u00a0One approach could be to deploy and/or reconfigure Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) in response to high network capacity demands. \u00a0However, accomplishing this in a dynamic environment requires substantial reconfiguration and/or extensions of an existing network. \u00a0Another approach could deploy and/or reconfigure small cells to address the challenge of high density in small areas.\u00a0 However, deploying large numbers of small cells requires a corresponding large number of equipment (and hence cost).\u00a0 More importantly, in a dynamic environment this can compromise latency, reliability and overall performance due to a high number of hand-offs between cells.\u00a0 Neither DAS nor small cells are required. \u00a0These approaches are intended only to illustrate the trade-offs between supporting high capacity while minimizing compromises in latency, reliability, and overall performance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop an initial concept design and plan for practical deployment of 5G RF coverage solutions. \u00a0Phase I will be a 6-month Period of Performance (PoP). \u00a0During this period there will be a kickoff, Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM), and a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).\u00a0 Prior to the end of Phase I, the performer will develop and present a proposed, detailed plan related to how they expect to address Phase II prototype production, test, and evaluation efforts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: During Phase II, the performer will begin the prototype production and test and evaluation process for transition. Phase II will be a 12-month PoP with a Critical Design Review at month six (6) and prototype demonstration at month nine (9) which is 3 months before contract end at month twelve (12).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrototype demonstration will be conducted at a DoD selected location, during which the prototype\u2019s capabilities must be successfully demonstrated. For budget and planning purposes, proposals should assume the test facility will be a DoD provided environment which will be a surface vessel or an environment which is identical in physical properties to a surface vessel.\u00a0 Test facilities may vary and will be determined as part of an award.\u00a0 A partial solution may be determined to be successful if the DoD determined it to be effective in a limited role.\u00a0 A Final Technical Report of the prototype capabilities as demonstrated at the Final Demonstration will also be required.\u00a0 Extended user evaluations or additional prototypes may be pursued to determine military utility.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The solution described in this topic has potential direct application to commercial applications such as container ships and cruise ships.\u00a0 These commercial environments have logistic tracking requirements that require RF solutions that deliver connectivity in very complex RF propagation environments.\u00a0 Additional military applications include multi-level underground and undersea mobile and fixed environments.\u00a0 Adaptability and flexibility in design and engineering of the solution is an additional benefit as these aspects will create more opportunities to solve similar coverage issues that were not initially identified.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tU.S. Patent US009766321B2 \u201cINDOOR POSITIONING WITH RADIO FREQUENCY CHIRP SIGNAL PROPAGATION DELAY MEASUREMENT\u201d is an example of a

Methods","branch":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency","topic_number":"DTRA234-P01","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Human-Machine Interfaces\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: DTRA seeks technologies to replace the user name/password default for authenticating users in various applications and services.\u00a0 The alternative proposed should be compatible with existing and emerging cloud/cloud-capable architectures, reduce the operational overhead for support, increase security over username/password defaults, and be \u2018user-friendly\u2019 to employ at the user interface application.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: While the principal user authentication used is the Public Key Encryption (PKI) used in tokens (Common Access Cards (CACs), Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards, etc.), the continued support of username/password authentication in some use cases poses an unwelcome burden to the services provided.\u00a0 Current password implementations require (increasingly longer) passwords containing mixes of upper case, lower case, numerical and special characters, which must be changed every 60 \u2013 90 days without repeating passwords maintained on lists for the previous 10-24 valid passwords.\u00a0 Brute force password cracking approaches have improved success rates employing parallelization of GPU and specialized hardware such as floating-point gate arrays (FPGAs) over the previous attempts using high-powered CPUs.\u00a0 A class of cryptologic techniques called \u2018memory hard\u2019 make these approaches ineffective, and form one of the key specific objectives for evaluation in this proposal.\u00a0 While commercial tokens (e.g. RSA and ORC PKI) are available to the public, they are not suitable for the first responders and foreign partners this topic supports due to various reasons (cost, availability, operational support and management, etc.)\u00a0 While token-based approaches are allowed for consideration, token-less approaches are preferred given the previously stated concerns.\u00a0 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance are the principal bodies establishing standards, which various government agencies accept as governing standards.\u00a0 However, the new password-less standard known as FIDO2, endorsed formally by Apple, Google, and Microsoft, suffer from two issues in this initial implementation:\u00a0 The three major companies adopting this standard are deploying three incompatible proprietary systems, subjecting users to maintaining multiple credentials per supported website to accommodate devices in each ecosystem.\u00a0 That imposes a burden on users for not only certificate maintenance per site and device, but also for transporting and maintaining that certificate cache securely across their individual devices and platforms.\u00a0 That limitation is not as important a concern for this topic and our use cases, but is critical for future commercial interests.\u00a0 The second current FIDO2 implementation problem is that each user\u2019s PKI certificate for each website must be stored in the cache (again multiplied per vendor).\u00a0 Caching of the certificate is a departure from the FIDO token PKI implementation that supports existing CAC/PIV architectures used by government agencies and is a principal requirement for this proposal topic.\u00a0 In summary, the attributes desired for any proposed solutions for this topic are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Solution must be a dramatic improvement in security, operation support and/or user experience for authenticating and managing disadvantaged users to replace username/password baseline\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encryption method must be a proven \u2018memory hard\u2019 approach and implementation to counter parallelized GPU/FPGA brute force or intelligent guessing to spoof authentication communications\r\n\r\n\u2022 System must be immune (or highly resistant) to common security compromise strategies; for example, such as \u2018man in the middle\u2019 or intercepted data replay attacks.\r\n\r\n\u2022 System must be standards compliant or compatible, e.g. compliant with or compatible to FIDO2 guidelines\r\n\r\n\u2022 System must be a vendor independent solution; e.g. must not be constrained to a single vendor\u2019s ecosystem or platform, and not impose large overhead in storing or transferring user credentials across supported systems.\u00a0 This dramatically reduces any migration issues across domains.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Analyze alternative approaches, providing at least two options to include summaries of technical feasibility of implementation and integration with existing systems, operations and maintenance for principal alternatives.\u00a0 Demonstrate depth of understanding through a detailed technical report for preferred option illustrating deployment into \u201cas is\u201d authentication systems with PKI as principal authentication method, but using username/PW as the default targeted for replacement by this investigation.\u00a0 The report should include a proposal for Phase II prototype development.\u00a0 The prototype should be developed not only to merge into existing DoD or other government agencies\u2019 systems, but should also be flexible enough for commercial deployment, such as small and medium businesses, local first responders, hospitals and clinics, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Implement a fully functional prototype of the proposed solution, to include server-side added functionality to support the concept to the user side authentication application.\u00a0 The prototype should be amenable to functional and security testing.\u00a0 The prototype should be capable of being implemented in either traditional application-centric or cloud services environments.\u00a0 Documentation should include user, operational and testing information.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Implement further improvements that would enhance use of the developed product by the sponsoring office, identify and exploit features that would be attractive for commercial or other applications.\u00a0 Expand upon the documentation developed in Phase II to include improvements implemented in Phase III.\u00a0 Investigate commercialization avenues that could include other government agencies, national labs, research institutes, and defense contractors.\u00a0 Develop a plan to enable successful technology transition at the end of this phase.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOpen Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten,

SCO is seeking innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in the following technology areas:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n1. Autonomous Systems:\u00a0 The use of autonomous systems in military operations provides several advantages, including allowing soldiers to avoid performing overly tedious or hazardous tasks and improved decision making for time-critical operations. The SCO is interested in technologies that can help accelerate and expand the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD\u2019s) use of autonomous systems as well as concepts for deterring or defeating an adversary\u2019s attempts to do the same.\u00a0 Recognizing the rapid advance of commercial autonomy applications, SCO particularly encourages concepts that leverage commercial investments in autonomy technologies.\u00a0\u00a0 Sub-categories of interest under Autonomous Systems include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improved Human/Autonomous System Interaction and Collaboration (HASIC) solutions for ground, sea, and air vehicles\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manned/unmanned Army ground vehicle collaboration that reduces risk to mission or risk to force\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Manned/unmanned tactical aircraft collaboration that improves targeting or weapon magazine depth for 5th generation aircraft\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low cost/medium range (200nm)/medium endurance organic tactical ISR for Army fire and maneuver elements to include artillery units and MLRS forces.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Communication systems, robotics, and algorithms for swarming, cooperative object interception, high speed and high precision optical navigation, and obstacle avoidance\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low-cost robotic systems, sensors, and compute\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n2. Machine Learning (ML):\u00a0 The ability to analyze large datasets quickly using deep learning algorithms could potentially provide significant military capabilities in the areas of indications and warnings (I&W) and automatic target recognition (ATR). Recent advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and neural networks, as well as the availability of massive amounts of computational power have made the prospect of fielding military systems that leverage deep learning in the near term a real possibility.\u00a0 Additionally advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and generative AI also hold to promise of changing the way tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are developed, data is summarized and acted upon, and the way control systems, cooperative effects delivery, and the ways software and physical systems are designed. SCO is interested in innovative concepts that benefit the warfighter by leveraging machine learning approaches.\u00a0 Sub-categories of interest under Machine Learning include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deep learning enabled by graphics processing unit (GPU) computing\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Approaches that use synthetic data to train neural networks\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Semantic processing\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ML applications for advanced modelling and simulation of militarily relevant problems\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RL/GAN generated physical systems, software, and control systems\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RL/GAN developed TTPs for swarming systems, concepts of operation (CONOPS), and software defined radios (SDRs)\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large Language Model (LLM) applications\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n3. Cyber:\u00a0 As U.S. adversaries have invested heavily in developing offensive cyber capabilities, the Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented a cyber-defense strategy designed to deter adversaries by ensuring that the military can detect, respond and remain resilient under cyber-attack.\u00a0 SCO is interested in leveraging advanced cyber related technologies that will enable the U.S. military to stay ahead of the evolving cyber threat.\u00a0 Sub-categories of interest under Cyber include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Network protection tools that provide ways to identify network vulnerabilities and provide automated operational security capabilities\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Novel cyber-defensive techniques that leverage commercial advances in anomaly-based detection, data analytics and/or encryption methods\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n4. Cross-Domain Kill Chains:\u00a0 Finding new ways to connect sensors with weapons to complete kill chains across the air, surface, and undersea domains is critical to countering near peer adversaries.\u00a0 The ability to link any capable sensor with any weapon transforms the concept of a \u201ckill chain\u201d, where any individual link is a single point of failure, to that of a \u201ckill web\u201d, where it will be difficult for an adversary to prevent a successful engagement.\u00a0 SCO is interested in exploring alternative combinations of existing or near-term sensors, communications, and weapons.\u00a0 Sub-categories of interest under Cross-Domain Kill Chains include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cross-domain fires/distributed lethality concepts\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Providing existing weapons with new capabilities (e.g., giving defensive weapons offensive capabilities, and vice versa)\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low probability of intercept, low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication waveforms and architectures for air, land, or sea platforms\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Machine-to-machine network tools that allow for seamless translation across multiple data formats and waveforms\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n5. Enhanced Surveillance and Reconnaissance:\u00a0 Discover novel ways to detect, identify, locate, and characterize a range of signatures-of-interest to the DoD using novel and unconventional platforms. New platforms, and enhancements to existing platforms, are desired in all domains:\u00a0 subsea, surface, terrestrial, air, space, and cyber.

For use in sensitive topics of human relations and interaction. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: A true assessment still needs to be completed to test the effectiveness and adequacy of legacy and novel technological approaches to education and training (E&T) for Equal Opportunity (EO) practitioners. There is a need to develop and integrate adaptive learning approaches that tailor EO trainings that respond and adapt to the learner\u2019s capabilities. Therefore, the purpose of this topic is to develop technological and methodological approaches that will utilize realistic synthetic representations of human relation training scenarios that are adaptive and scalable on the level of difficulty, sufficiently matched fidelity, and elicit the appropriate behavioral interactions and cues to sufficiently elicit learning and transferability of interpersonal skills for use in training EO practitioners such as interpersonal relationships, team development, and resiliency. The need for this approach will potentially overcome the limitations of current educational modalities (e.g., didactic lectures, case studies, observations), which do not provide the complexity to replicate the nuances of real-life situations accurately and may result in the underdevelopment of the necessary abilities to embrace the complex and varied roles an EO practitioner fully. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nModernization of E&T is necessary to ensure that future EO practitioners are fully equipped with the necessary tools and skills to address and prevent complex human relations issues. Simulation learning (SL) will fill the gap in current E&T approaches by providing a tailored, interactive, and scalable learning environment that ensure acquisition of the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) with fidelity. SL is an appropriate approach to EO education and training because it has demonstrated evidence to increase knowledge structuring, which is particularly important skill set for EO practitioners. SL also provides a tailored and adaptive approach to problem-solving skill development. Wherein the learner can progress at a pace that encourages mastery over completion - this is accomplished using realistic synthetic representations of adverse human relations events, which promote creativity in the learner to develop new solutions, critical thinking (i.e., reflection), formulate one or more solutions, establish, or recall strategies to implement the solution(s), discover new possible solutions, and explain the problem (i.e., understanding) and provide a realistic and actionable solution (i.e., evaluation).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrevious research indicates an increased proficiency in tasks and skill development when simulation training is included, as opposed to traditional classroom training alone. Specifically, SL is more effective than traditional learning approaches at increasing knowledge structuring for human relation topics. SL also provides a tailored and adaptive approach to problem-solving skill development. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe advantage of SL over traditional educational modalities is that it provides an environment that encourages transformative learning for the EO practitioner. SL is an immersive experience to addressing complex human relation scenarios wherein the learner is allowed to remain fully emerged, creating a higher sense of presence over face-to-face learning modules, which increases human relation skillsets, such as establishing contact with the victim, sharing emotions or ideas, and developing cooperation skills, such as awareness of others&#39; ideas, tolerance toward others, and empathy.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSL also provides instructors with real-time objective data to assess the learners&#39; mastery of job tasks or acquisition of new skills. SL objective data reduces threats to internal validity typically associated with human relations assessments because it removes the instructors&#39; subjective self-observations. SL gives the DoD the ability to train and educate a broader audience in a variety of locations, with potentially fewer human resources, leveraging already funded technologies in development by other research organizations, thus saving millions of dollars, advancing the methods currently utilized in training and education (E&T) in human relations domain, and provide readily accessible and realistic refresher training for EO practitioners. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) seeks solutions leveraging AI and SL to support the training of equal opportunity, equal employment, and diversity and inclusion practitioners to respond to challenging social issues happening in our military and other government agencies. These technologies should aid with the rapid development of very immersive and realistic scenarios portraying today\u2019s social challenges like racism, extremism, discrimination, harassment, etc. This training tool should be able to address the development of interpersonal skills, trigger a change in behavior, and deliver the knowledge-based training effectively.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tComplexity \u2013 When multiple topics converge causing the lines of distinction to become unclear. \r\n\tFidelity \u2013 the emersion or level of simulation that re-creates (simulates) a complex phenomenon, environment, or experience. \r\n\tInternal Validity \u2013 ability to accurately infer the causal relationship between two or more concepts. \r\n\tPresence \u2013 the self-reported feeling of emersion experience of the user in the virtual or simulated environment. \r\n\tRealistic Synthetic Representations - recreations of realistic equipment or people to represent real-world concepts or scenarios.\u00a0 \r\n\tSensitivity - The underlying accepts of the human relation topic that is too difficult, complex, challenge to express without causing emotional distress to other members.\u00a0 \r\n\tSerious Game \u2013 highly interactive computer-based games or simulations that creates a sense of full emersion and engagement for the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Develop a concept for creating realistic synthetic representations of adverse human relations issues suitable for use in training and education for EO practitioners. Demonstrate the feasibility of the concept to meet all the requirements as stated in the Description. Establish feasibility through modeling and analysis of the design to include the initial design specifications and capabilities description to build a prototype solution in Phase II. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDuring Phase 1, the following questions will be answered: \r\n\r\n1) How can we leverage simulation technology to enhance the learning experience? \r\n\r\n2) What is the correct stimulation level for a given learning objective or outcome? \r\n\r\n3) How does the fidelity of SL add or detract from the learning experience and E&T&#39;s effectiveness? \r\n\r\n4) At what point does the sensitivity or complexity of the human relation topic(s) under review render them unfit for SL? \r\n\r\n5) Will the learner perform accurate word tasks better after SL exposure? \r\n\r\n6) When can SL become independent from the instructor, mediator, or facilitator? \r\n\r\n7) What is the appropriate level of physical fidelity to accurately represent the necessary KSAs for EO practitioners? \r\n\r\n8) Can SL in human relations present an opportunity to construct an adaptive learning environment that presents the learner with a personalized and adaptive curriculum and test based on ability? \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: Develop and demonstrate prototypes M&S tool in a realistic environment. Conduct testing to prove feasibility over extended operating conditions. Develop a rapid scenario development methodology and traditional training conversion to M&S at the applicable and appropriate level of fidelity and complexity, in addition to a methodology on how to properly evaluate the outcomes and performance of the students during training engagements. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Supports the transition of EO modular simulation learning components to military training programs and the commercial market. The technology developed under this topic could create a dynamic training approach for industry and DoD programs. The innovation sought with this effort will reduce reliance on instructor capabilities, thus increasing T&E fidelity. \r\n\r\nThis simulation technology is applicable in a broad range of military and civilian E&T applications where the nature of topics is sensitive, and an expert instructor or SME is not easily accessible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1. \u201cNational Defense Strategy\u201d. 2022.

Current research captures proto-narratives at a snapshot in time and can track the engagement of audiences with a particular proto-narrative over a time period. However, narratives are not static; they evolve in the course of engagement by audiences. The main features of technology development should focus on constructing a quantitative model for tracking the evolution of narratives over time, including the transformation of one narrative into another, the dissolution of existing narratives, and the merging and splitting of strategic narratives from / into sub-narratives.\r\n\r\nPHASE I:  Conduct a feasibility study to assess what is in the art of the possible that satisfies the requirements specified in the above paragraphs entitled \u201cObjective\u201d and \u201cDescription.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough feasibility study (\u201cTechnology Readiness Level 3\u201d) to investigate what is in the art of the possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed technology.  The feasibility study should investigate all options that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this write up.  It should also address the risks and potential payoffs of the innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit. The funds obligated on the resulting Phase I SBIR contracts are to be used for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study using scientific experiments and laboratory studies as necessary.  Operational prototypes will not be developed with USSOCOM SBIR funds during Phase I feasibility studies.  Operational prototypes developed with other than SBIR funds that are provided at the end of Phase I feasibility studies will not be considered in deciding what firm(s) will be selected for Phase II.\r\n\r\nPHASE II:  Develop, install, and demonstrate a prototype system determined to be the most feasible solution during the Phase I feasibility study on an advanced analytic capability to detect, track, manage, and differentiate the evolution of narratives across social networks in the information environment. \r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:  This system has applicability in a broad range of other broader DoD, USG, or private company applications where planners, operators, and assessors must determine the most appropriate target audience for engagement to create effects in the information and cognitive domain, leading to physical behavior change. Advanced narrative detection would allow for better predictive analysis and create flexibility and more rapid responsiveness to changes in the information environment. This responsiveness is paramount for DoD strategic communications, intelligence agencies, and can benefit private companies needing to track shifts in conversation regarding social trends related to their products. Importantly, advanced narrative detection presents opportunity to track, measure, and assess changes over time, and to better assess effectiveness by correlating changes to events in the information environment.\r\nREFERENCES:  \r\n1.\tBail, C.

In 2015, Digital Trends Magazine posted an article stating that the Ford GT has close to 3 million more lines of code than a Boeing 787 Airliner. These additional lines of code translate to additional overhead in physical space, programming, sustainment, safety and security.  With vehicle trends moving more towards electric vehicles, to include military vehicles, industry is introducing new attack vectors for highly motivated and resourced enemies.  This increases the demand for military vehicles to address the growing cyber threat within all environments.  The technology areas of interest aim at addressing these attack vectors and exploring options to seamlessly integrate applicable technologies into Team Awareness Kit.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM OFFICE: Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV)\r\nThe technology areas of interests are:\r\n1.\tNavigation and Team Awareness Kit Integration: Inertial navigation systems within vehicles, vehicle positioning based on vehicle speed, steering and internal CANbus data, processing data from the Onboard Diagnostics II port, Global Positioning System integration, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), Team Awareness Kit, telematics and cybersecurity.\r\n2.\tForce Protection: Onboard Diagnostics II port, CANbus, Global Positioning System, Wi-Fi, on-board entertainment (infotainment) and information, facial recognition prevention, license place obfuscation, smart city data protection, residual and stored data from previous users, Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR), Fly Away Kits, Special Operation Forces (SOF) peculiar devices and cybersecurity.

Navigation system data will be formatted and passed to integrate seamlessly with the on-board vehicle Team Awareness Kit to provide feedback for all occupants. The innovative research should focus beyond analyzing Global Positioning System -like data to discover other capabilities and opportunities to utilize onboard vehicle data for future capabilities and includes all viable system design options with respective specifications provided. \r\n\r\nii)\tForce Protection: The sensor should plug into the Onboard Diagnostics II port, read data on the CANbus, ensure data and mission integrity, and communicate cyber risk to the operator while allowing them to manually disable telematics, such as Global Positioning System, Wi-Fi, on-board information and entertainment (\u201cinfotainment\u201d systems\u201d) on the fly. The sensor should include options to prevent facial recognition through the windshield, prevent recording data from the license plate and provide protections in an urban operating environment to include smart cities. The result of this topic should describe mechanisms disallowing a vehicle operator the ability to pull a previous operator\u2019s data that has been recorded and stored onboard the vehicle. the Phase I report must present the integration of carry-on and carry-off Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) equipment to include radios, and amplifiers with vehicle systems.\r\n\r\niii)\tOpen Architecture Electronic Control Unit: Implement SOCOM\u2019s unique requirements to selectively enable and/or disable standard vehicle features (traction control, GPS transmission, onboard telematics, prognostics, vehicle skid control, antilock brakes, airbag operation, fuel shutoff, limp home mode, exterior light output). Develop open architecture ECU that replaces the restrictive OEM ECUs.  This will replace the process of \u201chacking\u201d OEM ECUs in order to meet Non-Standard Commercial Vehicle requirements. This topic includes all viable system design options with respective specifications provided.\r\n\r\nNote: Please make sure to read the USSOCOM Instructions in full detail at https://www.defensesbirsttr.mil/SBIR-STTR/Opportunities/ at the bottom of the page under the tab titled \u201cDoD SBIR 23.4 Annual\u201d\r\nPHASE I:  Conduct a feasibility study to assess what is in the art of the possible that satisfies the requirements specified in the above paragraphs entitled \u201cObjective\u201d and \u201cDescription.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough feasibility study (\u201cTechnology Readiness Level 3\u201d) to investigate what is in the art of the possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed technology.

Solutions must enable the user to gather range measurements to target types that include, but are not limited to humans, vehicles and buildings. Solutions utilizing a laser transmitter for range measurement must maintain user safety by using a laser with wavelength greater than 1400 nanometers and also by not exceeding the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Class 1 laser hazard classification. \r\n\r\nPotential solutions shall be capable of surviving all environments that SOF encounters, including immersion, transportation vibration, high and low temperatures, high humidity, high altitude, drops and shocks, rain, ice, sand and dust, salt fog, and electromagnetic radiation. Participants are encouraged to outline the design trades associated with surviving immersion at 1 meter for 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe innovative research should focus on solutions that can be adapted to meet the size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints listed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLess than 18 oz. (1.125lbs) with power source(s) installed. \r\n\tLess than 64 cubic inches in volume, and not exceed 6 inches in either length, width, or height. \r\n\tPotential solutions must provide the operator with the following runtime profile before requiring a change of power source. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDaytime: 30 minutes of observation including 75 range measurements; and\r\n\t\t\tNighttime: 30 minutes of observation including 75 range measurements; and \r\n\t\t\t20 Rapid Ranging Events: A Rapid Ranging Event can be described as follows. User detects an object of interest while not using the device. User then picks up the device and utilizes its range measurement capability until user is confident, they have an accurate range measurement to the object of interest. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nClarifying Information: The purpose of this effort is not to generate precise target coordinates. For any target coordinates that the integrated sensing solution can generate, it should be able to communicate those digitally into TAK with all associated errors. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I:\u00a0 Conduct a feasibility study to assess what is in the art of the possible that satisfies the requirements specified in the above paragraphs entitled \u201cObjective\u201d and \u201cDescription.\u201d\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of this USSOCOM Phase I SBIR effort is to conduct and document the results of a thorough feasibility study (\u201cTechnology Readiness Level 3\u201d) to investigate what is in the art of the possible within the given trade space that will satisfy a needed technology.\u00a0 The feasibility study should investigate all options that meet or exceed the minimum performance parameters specified in this write up.\u00a0 It should address the risks and potential payoffs (including consequences to size, weight, power, and cost) of the innovative technology options that are investigated and recommend the option that best achieves the objective of this technology pursuit.

Applicants seeking a Phase II renewal or Phase IIB renewal must have received an eligible predicate award that is appropriate and relevant (e.g., pre-clinical studies, planning activities, etc.) to this FOA.\r\n\r\nAlthough clinical trials not considered high-risk (see NOT-AI-16-084) may be proposed, this program encourages high-risk clinical studies. High-risk does not imply human subject or patient risk, but rather defines a study that contains one or more of the following unique attributes: involves non-routine interventions, administration of an unlicensed product, or administration of a licensed product for an unapproved indication. Additionally, mechanistic studies are encouraged and can be proposed under this program. Applicants may not propose more than one clinical trial per application.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nOver the past three years, NIAID has committed over $5.5 billion to clinical research, of which $2.5 billion was devoted to clinical trials and supportive activities. Clinical trials are one research strategy NIAID uses to improve the understanding of the clinical mechanisms of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases or to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. For additional information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the NIAID, applicants are encouraged to consult the NIAID web site https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/role.\r\n\r\nNIAID Supported Clinical Trials and Infrastructure\r\n\r\nHistorically, NIAID supports both infrastructure and networks through a variety of funding mechanisms. These resources focus on high-priority disease research areas. Examples include the HIV/AIDS Clinical Trial Networks supported by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium, and the Immune Tolerance Network supported by the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT). NIAID's clinical research infrastructure includes coordinating centers, statistical units, data centers, central laboratories, clinical centers, and other specialized resources. For additional information on DAIDS supported clinical trials refer to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedures Documents. For additional information on DAIT Clinical Research Policies and Documents see: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/dait-clinical-research-policies-and-standards.\r\n\r\nInvestigator-Initiated Clinical Trials\r\n\r\nAlthough existing clinical trial programs and infrastructure are crucial to furthering the Institute's research, the NIAID recognizes that additional means to support clinical research may be important to advancing its research mission. Therefore, the NIAID has established the investigator-initiated clinical trial program for clinical trials that cannot or will not be conducted through existing NIAID-supported clinical trial networks or infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFor additional information about NIAID's investigator-initiated clinical trial program, see https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/investigator-initiated-clinical-trial-resources.\r\n\r\nScope\r\n\r\nThe NIAID SBIR Phase II Clinical Trial Implementation Cooperative Agreement (U44) program provides a unique and focused opportunity for small business concerns (SBCs) interested in conducting clinical trials. This FOA supports implementation of clinical trials from small business concerns (SBCs) that propose clinical trials in research areas that are well matched with the mission and goals of the NIAID. The proposed clinical trial should be hypothesis-driven and milestone-driven.\r\n\r\nAll clinical trial planning activities must be completed prior to the time of application submission and all requested documentation needs to be provided for an application to be considered complete for a Phase II award (except for Fast Track applications).\r\n\r\nInvestigators are referred to NIAID's Clinical Research Toolkit website for protocol templates and guidance, clinical research resources, and links to program divisions. Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact the NIAID Scientific/Research Contact(s) for information regarding division-specific clinical research policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThis FOA will support the conduct, completion, and analysis of a clinical trial, including activities related to the conduct of the clinical trial, which include but are not limited to the following:\r\n\r\ntraining of study personnel;\r\nenrollment and recruitment of study subjects;\r\ninvestigational product costs;\r\ndata collection, management and quality control;\r\nlaboratory work and data analyses;\r\nstudy management and oversight;\r\nestablishment of committees to manage the complexity of the trial;\r\npreparation of the final study report; and other related post-trial activities\r\nregulatory activities and site monitoring can be covered if required.\r\nmechanistic studies, if applicable\r\nEach NIAID Clinical Trial Implementation award will support the implementation of a single clinical trial that may include more than one intervention. Applications that include more than one clinical trial will not be supported by this FOA.\r\n\r\nAll clinical trial planning activities must be completed prior to the time of application submission and investigators must be ready to implement the proposed trial at the time of award.\r\n\r\nNIAID reserves the right to specify: 1) whether an IND/IDE application should be submitted to an appropriate regulatory agency; 2) the entity (NIAID, primary awardee, etc.) who will hold the IND/IDE; 3) the requirements for the establishment of a DSMB (Data Safety Monitoring Board)/SMC (Safety Monitoring Committee) or the use of an NIAID sponsored DSMB; and 4) the use of other clinical resources such as a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center. Applicants are encouraged to discuss those decisions and requirements with NIAID prior to submission of the application.\r\n\r\nMechanistic studies will be supported as part of all clinical trials in this FOA. DAIT strongly encourages the inclusion of mechanistic studies in any DAIT supported trials.\r\n\r\nInvestigators are referred to the Division-specific research policies and standard procedures for protocol templates, guidance, and requirements for clinical trials. See Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedure Documents; Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Office of Clinical Research Affairs; Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) Clinical Research Policies and Standards. Investigators are also referred to NIAID's Clinical Research Toolkit website https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/trans-niaid-clinical-research-toolkit. Prior to initiation, protocols and consent forms may be subject to review by the NIAID Division.

The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.\r\n\r\nThe development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the \u201cValley of Death\u201d). To achieve commercialization, some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable grant-in-aid financing beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve follow-on investment or commercialization. In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically diverse patient populations.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this FOA, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:\r\n\r\nAddress a rare disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act Amendment of 1984 as any disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States\r\nQualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year\r\nTarget a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (","sbir_topic_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/1951189","subtopics":[]}]},{"solicitation_title":"DoD 23.D STTR Annual BAA","solicitation_number":"23.D STTR Annual BAA","program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","agency":"Department of Defense","branch":"N/A","solicitation_year":"2023","release_date":"2022-11-15","open_date":"2022-11-15","close_date":"2023-12-31","application_due_date":["2023-12-31"],"occurrence_number":null,"sbir_solicitation_link":"https://www.sbir.gov/node/2272843","solicitation_agency_url":"https://www.defensesbirsttr.mil/","current_status":"open","solicitation_topics":[{"topic_title":"High Efficiency X-ray (HEX) Production","branch":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","topic_number":"HR0011ST2023D","topic_description":"OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Weapons\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: Design and develop high efficiency targets for the conversion of electrons to x-rays with performance beyond that of typical high atomic number bremsstrahlung converters.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This topic area will explore new materials and physics for higher efficiency electron to x-ray conversion. High energy electrons, up to 10 MeV, can be produced for irradiation applications, but have limited penetration (~several centimeters) or are deleterious to the organoleptic characteristics of some types of food, such as meat proteins. High energy x-rays up to 7.5 MeV have improved penetration and do not change the desired organoleptic characteristics. However, the conversion of electrons to x-rays is an inefficient process, with conversion efficiencies of < ~10%.  Slowing electrons down through the bremsstrahlung process is typically used to create x-rays from an electron beam striking a high atomic number target (such as tungsten or tantalum). This STTR will focus on the use of advanced materials and new approaches to more efficiently convert electrons to photons and demonstrate performance in a food irradiation application. Approaches could include nanostructure engineered crystalline targets making use of electron and x-ray diffraction, nano-channel targets, energy recycling, or direct beam-wave interactions. Advances could make a significant impact for many applications beyond food irradiation such as medical device sterilization and non-destructive test and evaluation.\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase I will demonstrate feasibility of high efficiency electron to x-ray conversion through modeling and preliminary experiments. Specifically, efficient conversion of x-rays is sought at 5 MeV to 7.5 MeV energies corresponding to upper regulatory limits for food irradiation applications. Successful performers will achieve a minimum of > 20% conversion efficiency, and work to reach the objective performance goal of > 50% conversion efficiency. Such efficiencies would substantially advance the state of the art and potentially allow for lower cost systems with lower size, weight, and power for a range of applications. Beam forming is a secondary goal of the program, with interest in pencil or fan-beams. Phase I will also include preliminary manufacturability studies and economic analysis activities indicating the suitability of the approach for cost-sensitive applications such as food irradiation.   \r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables Phase I fixed milestones for this program must include: \r\n\u2022\tMonth 1: Initial report detailing proposed conversion system supported with preliminary modeling and empirical data, including anticipated x-ray energy distributions \r\n\u2022\tMonth 3: Report on the conversion system\u2019s likelihood of achieving program efficiency goals, supported by experimental, simulated or modeled data \r\n\u2022\tMonth 5: Interim report describing efficiency performance, manufacturability, and cost of proposed target system \r\n\u2022\tMonth 7: Update to interim report: Given this report needs to support the Phase II proposal, it should provide compelling evidence the conversion system can achieve overall program efficiency (threshold 20%, objective 50%) and suitability goals (operation in high energy, high current environments) \r\n\u2022\tMonth 8: Final Phase I report summarizing technical approach and status in achieving Phase I goals and plans to achieve program goals by the end of Phase II; this should be a culmination of the Phase 1 effort, demonstrating a viable technical path supported by empirical and modeling data to achieving overall program goals, with risks and mitigation strategies fully detailed Monthly written technical progress reports (see template under SBIR/STTR BAA DOCUMENTS at https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/for-small-businesses/participate-sbir-sttr-program) \r\n\r\nAll proposals must include the following meetings in the proposed schedule and costs: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tVirtual kickoff for Phase I \r\n\u2022\tRegular monthly teleconference meetings with the Government team for progress reporting as well as problem identification and mitigation; proposers typically prepare a slide deck to aid in the discussion \r\n\r\nPHASE II: Phase II will further develop and refine proof-of-concept conversion systems, culminating with the demonstration of performance goals under high current conditions. Phase II will evaluate conversion systems under realistic conditions for food treatment with continuous beam powers ranging from 2 kW to 10 kW. The conversion systems will demonstrate maintaining x-ray production efficiency goals while addressing practical engineering issues such as mechanical stress and thermal management. Proposers should outline specific metrics and conditions for test that align with their commercialization strategy. The Phase II option will develop a strategy to integrate the conversion system with the DARPA SBIR Safe Food for Everyone (SaFE) program electron accelerator. Additionally, the option period will explore producing usable quantities of the optimized conversion systems with low-cost techniques, support demonstrations meeting program goals, and define a minimum viable product for food irradiation applications.\r\n\r\nSchedule/Milestones/Deliverables.

Alternatively, a bistatic architecture with modern track camera frame rates and image processing techniques should now be able to achieve comparable accuracy, providing a beam control solution for on-gimbal, phased-array laser sources while significantly reducing the SWaP of the beam control system.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPerformers will develop methodologies and tracking algorithms required to perform LWS engagements using a bistatic architecture, where the tracking and imaging path is separate from the outgoing laser path. Performers also will develop jitter mitigation techniques, aimpoint maintenance via electronic beam steering methods, and atmospheric compensation strategies. All traditional functions of a beam control and tracking system are required. These functions include target acquisition, closed loop track, aimpoint selection and maintenance, and atmospheric compensation.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLimitations to an all on-gimbal architecture will be identified by the performer, to include performance limitations as a function of camera aperture size, total system size, and laser power.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExpected deliverables include the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDescriptions of possible physical implementations of on-gimbal beam control systems \r\n\tPerformance predictions for the performer\u2019s chosen physical architecture \r\n\tIncluding peak and average irradiance for a variety of slant ranges and elevation angles \r\n\tIdentification of viable algorithms for jitter mitigation, aimpoint maintenance, and atmospheric compensation \r\n\tAnalysis of the ability to scale the performer\u2019s approach, with respect to effective range and target type, for three laser powers: 12 kW, 50 kW, 150 kW \r\n\tLaboratory demonstration of the performer\u2019s on-gimbal LWS design utilizing a performer-chosen low-power phased array\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExpected key metrics:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSWaP comparison between on-gimbal and CPCM LWS of similar laser power and aperture size \r\n\tMinimum achievable jitter and aimpoint error \r\n\tAtmospheric compensation capability; Strehl, or power-in-the-bucket at the target, as a function of turbulence strength and slant range\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: During Phase I, the performers will conceptualize a low-power, low-SWaP phased-array Laser Weapon System (LWS) where all hardware and functionalities are located on-gimbal, with the exception of subsystems for power generation/storage and thermal management. The LWS must contain all capabilities of a traditional LWS: acquisition, tracking, pointing (ATP), laser generation, adaptive optics (AO), and system/mission controls. It is assumed that adaptive optics and fine angle beam steering will be performed via the piston phase control capability of the phased array. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo perform the ATP and AO functions without using CPCM, contractors will need to identify viable algorithms and methodologies to establish laser aimpoint relative to tracker line-of-sight, perform aimpoint control, measure instantaneous turbulence distortion, and apply correct wavefront conjugations.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPerformers will then design a low-power, on-gimbal, LWS meeting the above requirements. A low-power optical phased array of the performers\u2019 choice, to include fiber-based laser technology, may be used in the LWS design. For this demonstration, the laser source (seed, amplifiers, phase modulators) may be off-gimbal, but the laser array head, or emitting apertures, must be on-gimbal. System size (number of sub-apertures, number of track cameras, etc.) is to be defined by the performer.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRequired Phase I deliverables include the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonth 3:\u00a0 A Systems Requirements Review (SRR) for the low-power, on-gimbal LWS, to include a presentation at PI meeting of the requirements.\r\n\tMonth 5:\u00a0 Report summarizing modelling and simulation software capabilities. Presentation at PI meeting on capabilities.\r\n\tMonth 9:\u00a0 A Preliminary Design for the low-power, on-gimbal LWS, to include a list of any long lead purchases required, to include a presentation at PI meeting of the design.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonth 10: Phase I final report summarizing Phase I work, to include identification of viable algorithms for beam control, aimpoint maintenance, wavefront measurement/correction, and phase control. Presentation at final PI meeting of accomplishments.\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: During Phase II, the performers will build the low-power, on-gimbal LWS designed in Phase I, and demonstrate the system under controlled scenarios in a laboratory setting. Contractors will be required to predict the performance of the as-built system, then compare these results to the laboratory tests. Contractors will also be responsible for defining the laboratory test objectives and success criteria; however, the testing must demonstrate all functionalities described above in the Description.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPerformers will also conduct modeling and simulation of three on-gimbal LWS variants utilizing a government reference laser source with output powers of 12 kW, 50 kW and 150 kW. Volumes (length x width x height), and masses of the three laser sources, as well as piston phase modulation rates will be based on state-of-the-art laser sources and provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI). System optimization of each variant will be based on achievable Strehl ratios as a function of slant range and engagement angle.\u00a0 Other parameters of interest to the government are achievable slew rates, residual jitter estimates, and system weight and volume reductions when compared to traditional CPCM systems.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase II deliverables include the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonth 4:\u00a0 A Critical Design for the low-power, on-gimbal LWS, to include a presentation at PI meeting of the design.\r\n\tMonth 12:\u00a0 Report containing trade study results for the three laser powers listed above.

Presentation at PI meeting of results. \r\n\tMonth 24:\u00a0 Design documents for the low-power, on-gimbal LWS, to include a list of all hardware purchased under contract, as well as a detailed explanation of the algorithms and methods used for ATP and AO, and source code for ATP and AO functions. Phase II Final Report to include a summary of tasks completed during Phase 2, a list of identified changes required to scale the LWS design to higher powers and channel counts, and any recommended system improvements. Presentation at final PI meeting of accomplishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: One potential application of BEAM technology is to marry the laser arrays under development in the DARPA Modular Efficient Laser Technology program (https://www.darpa.mil/program/modular-efficient-laser-technology) with the beam control architectures of BEAM. A high-power, on-gimbal, system could be used on a large variety of ground vehicles for C-UAS and potentially even for counter-mortar missions. Such a low-SWaP system could be used by Special Forces for operational preparation of the battlespace. Finally, airborne applications on smaller UAS might become available depending on the performance results of Phase II.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1. Kenneth W. Billman, Bruce A.

Not only is there a shortfall of cybersecurity professionals, there\u2019s a lack in the preparedness of hired professionals to perform critical cybersecurity tasks. Studies have found that only half of hired recent graduates in cybersecurity are adequately prepared to carry out their duties [4, 5]. That is, the skills gap is even worse than often stated, as even filled positions might represent missing talent. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne reason for this skills gap is the inadequacy of current training/education techniques. Training techniques need to be both scalable, to address the sheer size of the skills gap, and effectively in-depth, because adequately understanding the security of every additional layer in a system requires a workable understanding of the security of the underlying layers. Unfortunately, most current training approaches in cybersecurity fail to achieve both adequate scalability and efficacy to properly prepare learners in the foundational concepts of critical cyber operational skills.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis lack of practical training/education puts mission-critical offensive and defensive cyberspace operations at risk and drives cybersecurity talent shortages.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe objective of COPE is to push forward the state-of-the-art in rapid and effective cybersecurity training to address the current skills gap in the cybersecurity workforce.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: Phase 1 of COPE will explore feasibility by: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tConducting a study on cybersecurity job vacancies and required skillsets across the Department of Defense (DoD), intelligence community (IC), US government (USG), and industry; the study will identify specific security concepts needed by each;\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\tDeveloping a curriculum and scalable training/education framework with technical capabilities to teach critical cybersecurity concepts such as network security operations, threat hunting, ransomware prevention and recovery, etc.; \r\n\tIdentifying potential DoD, IC, USG, and industry benefactors of the advanced security training and working with them on pilot iterations of the training; and\r\n\tDemonstrating the pilot training capability and evaluating its efficacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPhase 1 deliverables and milestones for COPE should include: \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMonths 2, 4, 6, and 8: report detailing technical progress made to date, tasks accomplished, current risks/mitigations, plan for the remainder of Phase 1 (e.g., tasks to be accomplished, planned activities/trips/meeting), trip/meeting summaries, and a summary of any potential issues or problem areas (technical or financial) that require the attention of the DARPA PM.

Offerors are advised foreign nationals proposed to perform on this topic may be restricted due to the technical data under US Export Control Laws.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: DTRA seeks technologies to replace the user name/password default for authenticating users in various applications and services.\u00a0 The alternatives proposed by the commercial/non-profit team should be compatible with existing and emerging cloud/cloud-capable architectures, reduce the operational overhead for support, increase security over username/password defaults, and be \u2018user-friendly\u2019 to employ at the user interface application.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: While the principal user authentication used is the Public Key Encryption (PKI) used in tokens (Common Access Cards (CACs), Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards, etc.), the continued support of username/password authentication in some use cases poses an unwelcome burden to the services provided.\u00a0 Current password implementations require (increasingly longer) passwords containing mixes of upper case, lower case, numerical and special characters, which must be changed every 60 \u2013 90 days without repeating passwords maintained on lists for the previous 10-24 valid passwords.\u00a0 Brute force password cracking approaches have improved success rates employing parallelization of GPU and specialized hardware such as floating-point gate arrays (FPGAs) over the previous attempts using high-powered CPUs.\u00a0 A class of cryptologic techniques called \u2018memory hard\u2019 make these approaches ineffective, and form one of the key specific objectives for evaluation in this proposal.\u00a0 While commercial tokens (e.g. RSA and ORC PKI) are available to the public, they are not suitable for the first responders and foreign partners this topic supports due to various reasons (cost, availability, operational support and management, etc.)\u00a0 While token-based approaches are allowed for consideration, token-less approaches are preferred given the previously stated concerns. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance are the principal bodies establishing standards, which various government agencies accept as governing standards.\u00a0 However, the new password-less standard known as FIDO2, endorsed formally by Apple, Google and Microsoft, suffer from two issues in this initial implementation:\u00a0 the three major companies adopting this standard are deploying three incompatible proprietary systems, subjecting users to maintaining multiple credentials per supported website to accommodate devices in each ecosystem.\u00a0 That imposes a burden on users for not only certificate maintenance per site per device, but also for transporting and maintaining that certificate cache securely across their individual devices and platforms.\u00a0 That limitation is not as important a concern for this topic and our use cases, but is critical for future commercial interests.\u00a0 The second current FIDO2 implementation problem is that each user\u2019s PKI certificate for each website must be stored in the cache (again multiplied per vendor.)\u00a0 This is a departure from the FIDO token PKI implementation that supports existing CAC/PIV architectures used by government agencies, and is a principal requirement for this proposal topic.\u00a0 In summary, the attributes desired for any proposed solutions for this topic are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Solution must be a dramatic improvement in security, operation support and/or user experience for authenticating and managing disadvantaged users to replace username/password baseline\r\n\r\n\u2022 Encryption method must be a proven \u2018memory hard\u2019 approach and implementation to counter parallelized GPU/FPGA brute force or intelligent guessing to spoof authentication communications\r\n\r\n\u2022 System must be immune (or highly resistant) to common security compromise strategies; for example, such as \u2018man in the middle\u2019 or intercepted data replay attacks.\r\n\r\n\u2022 System must be standards compliant or compatible, e.g. compliant with or compatible to FIDO2 guidelines\r\n\r\n\u2022 System must be a vendor independent solution; e.g. must not be constrained to a single vendor\u2019s ecosystem or platform, and not impose large overhead in storing or transferring user credentials across supported systems.\u00a0 This dramatically reduces any migration issues across domains.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE I: PHASE I \u2013 Proof of Concept:\r\n\r\nAnalyze alternative approaches, providing at least two options to include summaries of technical feasibility of implementation and integration with existing systems, operations and maintenance for principal alternatives.\u00a0 Demonstrate depth of understanding through a technical report for preferred options illustrating deployment into \u201cas is\u201d authentication systems with PKI as principal authentication method, but using username/PW as the default targeted for replacement by this investigation.\u00a0 The report should include a detailed proposal for the preferred option to implement Phase II prototype development.\u00a0 The prototype should be developed not only to merge into existing DoD or other government agencies\u2019 systems, but should also be flexible enough for commercial deployment, such as small and medium businesses, local first responders, hospitals and clinics, etc.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE II: PHASE II - Prototype Development:\r\n\r\nImplement a fully functional prototype of the proposed solution, to include server-side added functionality to support the concept to the user side authentication application.\u00a0 The prototype should be amenable to functional and security testing.\u00a0 The prototype should be capable of being implemented in either traditional application-centric or cloud services environments.\u00a0 Documentation should include user, operational and testing information.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Implement further improvements that would enhance use of the developed product by the sponsoring office, identify and exploit features that would be attractive for commercial or other applications.\u00a0 Expand upon the documentation developed in Phase II to include improvements implemented in Phase III.\u00a0 Investigate commercialization avenues that could include other government agencies, national labs, research institutes, and defense contractors.\u00a0 Develop a plan to enable successful technology transition at the end of this phase.\u00a0

severe and more frequent in recent decades.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nIn the context of a warming, changing climate, extreme weather, water, and climate events are becoming more common. Extreme high temperatures in the U.S. are projected to increase. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events in most parts of the U.S. are projected to increase, and future droughts in most regions will likely be stronger and potentially last longer. The frequency, depth, and extent of tidal flooding are expected to continue to increase in the future, as is the more severe flooding associated with coastal storms, flooding, shoreline erosion, disruptions to commercial navigation and tourism. As the climate changes, extreme events are becoming more prevalent, and compound extreme events are leading to cascading hazards.

The goal of this initiative is to stimulate research that advances alternative routes of drug delivery systems for multipurpose prevention technologies for use by adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), such as injectable, implantable, or transdermal. Specifically, this initiative will advance knowledge that would result in innovative delivery systems or approaches so that adolescent girls and young adult women can have effective and reliable options that align with their preferred mode of delivery.\r\n\r\nSpecific Areas of Research Interest\r\n\r\nApplicants are encouraged to consider specifying clinical and nonclinical research milestones and timelines for their proposed research. Inclusion of biobehavioral research, integrated into an MPT drug development program, focused on optimizing the rheological and biophysical properties of the product for use by target populations is encouraged. Applications may address one or more of the following interest topics.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of MPT formulations, systemic for HIV and pregnancy prevention in formulations and/or drug platforms that are appropriate for administration to adolescent and young adults.\r\nStudies involving the investigation of pharmacologic properties of proposed formulations in animal models to understand the interaction of the formulation with endocrine, physiologic and other biochemical changes experienced among, adolescent and young adult populations.\r\nDevelopment of sustained/extended release MPTs that provide months to years of protection from pregnancy and HIV and in women using a single dose or a constant delivery DDS.\r\nUnderstanding the PK and PD of MPT products by mapping the contraceptive, antiviral lag period (time to establish effective concentrations) and tails (time to loss of effective concentrations) for sustained/extended release MPTs.\r\nUnderstanding the potential for and identifying/characterizing DDI that could compromise a pregnancy prevention and HIV and MPT safety and effectiveness.\r\nThe NIAID specific areas of scientific interest for the FOA will be:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of episodic dosed MPTs for use during periods of sexual activity with a minimum of 7 days protection from a single dose for MPTs targeting HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) for cis and trans males and females.\r\nDevelopment of sustained/extended release MPTs that provide months to years of protection from HIV and/or STI infection and pregnancy in women using a single dose or a constant drug delivery system (DDS), which may be modeled after the highly effective long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) strategies for durations and use patterns.\r\nDevelopment of animal models (single model or separate harmonized animal models) that evaluate the efficacy and safety of the active ingredients of a multiple indication MPT product.\r\nUnderstanding the potential for and identifying/characterizing drug-drug interactions (DDI) that could compromise MPT safety and effectiveness.\r\nUnderstanding the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of MPT products by mapping the antiviral and/or contraceptive duration, lag period (time to establish effective concentrations) and low-level drug tails (time to loss of effective concentrations) during non-use periods, such as menstruation or between dose renewals for episodic and sustained/extended release MPTs.\r\nDevelopment MPTs that deliver effective HIV and STI drug concentrations to both the female reproductive tract (FRT) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of males and females.\r\nUnderstanding the biobehavioral factors which govern decisions made by individuals to use MPTs (look, feel, and duration). For this FOA, biobehavioral factors are defined as the rheological/biophysical properties of the MPT DDS that invoke user judgments, leading to decisions for first, subsequent use or non-use and/or early termination.\r\nNIMH Areas of Research Interest\r\n\r\nNIMH is interested in studies that propose an MPT with an HIV prevention component, and that include a strong behavioral science component integrated into the development of the MPT.
